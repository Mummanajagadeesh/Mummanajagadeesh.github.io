RISC-V, an open-source ISA, is reshaping the VLSI design landscape by enabling deeper hardware-software co-design, architectural customization at the RTL level, and tighter control over power, performance, and area (PPA)—without the constraints of licensing or closed specifications&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to VLSI Design Flow: RTL to GDSII</title><link>https://mummanajagadeesh.github.io/blog/vlsi-design-flow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 05:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mummanajagadeesh.github.io/blog/vlsi-design-flow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Wonder why AI, modern smartphones, and countless digital devices have become so powerful yet compact? The secret lies in the ability to pack billions of transistors into tiny silicon chips — a feat accomplished through &lt;strong>Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI)&lt;/strong>. At the core of this accomplishment is a complex, multi-step design flow that transforms abstract hardware concepts into a physical chip ready for fabrication.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
