Understanding the math behind it allows us to grasp why it has 43 quintillion possible states, how we categorize moves, and why some solutions are more efficient than others.</p><h4 id="group-theory-and-the-rubiks-cube"><strong>Group Theory and the Rubik’s Cube</strong></h4><p>Group theory is a branch of mathematics that studies sets with operations that follow specific rules. The Rubik’s Cube can be seen as a mathematical group where:</p><ul><li>Each state of the cube is an element of the group.</li><li>Each valid move (rotating a face) is a group operation.</li><li>The identity element is the solved state of the cube.</li><li>Moves have inverses (e.g., turning the right face clockwise can be undone by turning it counterclockwise).</li></ul><p>The Rubik’s Cube belongs to a finite group since it has a limited number of positions. The set of all possible cube configurations, with the operation of applying a sequence of moves, forms a non-abelian group (meaning that order matters—doing move A then B is not the same as doing move B then A).</p><p>Here’s the updated version incorporating center orientation in the usual order for 3×3 scales:</p><h4 id="order-of-an-element-in-the-rubiks-cube-group"><strong>Order of an Element in the Rubik’s Cube Group</strong></h4><p>In group theory, the order of an element is the number of times it must be applied to return to the identity (solved state). In the Rubik’s Cube, certain moves or sequences have different orders:</p><ul><li>A single quarter-turn of a face has order 4 (doing it four times returns the cube to the original state).</li><li>A 180-degree turn has order 2.</li><li>Certain complex sequences have higher orders, meaning they take more repetitions to cycle back to the starting position.</li><li>On a standard 3×3 Rubik’s Cube, center pieces do not change position, but their orientation can matter in some cases, such as in supercube variants where sticker orientation is tracked. In such cases, center rotations may introduce elements of order 2 or 4, depending on the move sequence.</li></ul><p>Understanding the order of moves, including center orientation, helps in designing efficient solving algorithms.</p><h4 id="counting-the-43-quintillion-permutations"><strong>Counting the 43 Quintillion Permutations</strong></h4><p>To compute the number of possible Rubik’s Cube states, we analyze the degrees of freedom:</p><ul><li>There are 8 corner pieces, each of which can be arranged in (8!) ways.</li><li>Each corner has three orientations, giving (3^7) possibilities (the last one is determined by the others).</li><li>There are 12 edge pieces, which can be arranged in (12!) ways.</li><li>Each edge has two orientations, giving (2^{11}) possibilities (the last one is determined by the others).</li><li>However, only even permutations of corners and edges are possible, so we divide by 2.</li></ul><p>Thus, the total number of possible Rubik’s Cube states is:</p><p>$$
\frac{8! \times 3^7 \times 12! \times 2^{11}}{2} = 43,252,003,274,489,856,000
$$</p><p>which is approximately<strong>43 quintillion</strong>.</p><p>For the<strong>2×2×2 Rubik’s Cube</strong>, we use a similar method but without considering edges:</p><ul><li>The 8 corner pieces can be arranged in (8!) ways.</li><li>Each has 3 orientations, giving (3^7) (since the last one is determined).</li><li>Only even permutations are possible, so we divide by 2.</li></ul><p>Thus, the number of possible 2×2×2 states is:</p><p>$$
\frac{8! \times 3^7}{2} = 3,674,160
$$</p><p>which is significantly smaller than the 3×3×3 but still quite large.</p><h4 id="gods-number-and-move-metrics"><strong>God’s Number and Move Metrics</strong></h4><p>God’s Number is the maximum number of moves required to solve the worst-case scenario of a Rubik’s Cube optimally. In 2010, researchers proved that God’s Number for a standard 3×3×3 Rubik’s Cube is<strong>20 moves</strong> in the<strong>quarter-turn metric</strong> (where each 90-degree face turn counts as one move).</p><h5 id="move-metrics">Move Metrics</h5><ul><li><strong>Quarter-Turn Metric (QTM)</strong>: Every 90-degree turn is counted as one move. This is the standard used in the 20-move God’s Number proof.</li><li><strong>Half-Turn Metric (HTM)</strong>: Both 90-degree and 180-degree turns count as one move. In this metric, God’s Number is<strong>18 moves</strong>.</li><li><strong>Face-Turn Metric (FTM)</strong>: Any rotation of a face, whether 90, 180, or 270 degrees, is counted as one move.</li></ul><p>Different solving methods optimize for different metrics. For example, speedcubers prioritize<strong>fewer moves in practice</strong> rather than the theoretical minimum number of moves.</p><h4 id="euclidean-and-quaternion-mathematics-in-the-rubiks-cube"><strong>Euclidean and Quaternion Mathematics in the Rubik’s Cube</strong></h4><h5 id="euclidean-geometry-and-the-rubiks-cube"><strong>Euclidean Geometry and the Rubik’s Cube</strong></h5><p>The Rubik’s Cube exists in three-dimensional Euclidean space, meaning its transformations can be represented using classical geometric tools such as matrices and vector operations.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rotation Matrices:</strong> Each face rotation can be described using a 3×3 rotation matrix. A 90-degree clockwise rotation about the x, y, or z-axis can be represented as:</p><p>$$
R_x(90^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},
$$</p><p>$$
R_y(90^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},
$$</p><p>$$
R_z(90^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$</p></li><li><p><strong>Vector Representation:</strong> Each cubie (small cube piece) has a position vector ( v ), and applying a rotation matrix transforms it to a new position:
$$
v&rsquo; = R v.
$$
Using these transformations, all possible moves on the cube can be described mathematically.</p></li></ul><h5 id="quaternion-representation-and-the-rubiks-cube"><strong>Quaternion Representation and the Rubik’s Cube</strong></h5><p>Quaternions offer an alternative way to describe rotations in 3D space. A quaternion is defined as:
$$
q = a + bi + cj + dk,
$$
where ( a, b, c, d ) are real numbers, and ( i, j, k ) are imaginary unit vectors satisfying specific multiplication rules.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rotation Using Quaternions:</strong> Any 3D rotation can be represented as:
$$
q = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) + \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)(xi + yj + zk),
$$
where ( \theta ) is the rotation angle, and ( (x, y, z) ) is the rotation axis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Applying a Rotation:</strong> Given a point represented by a quaternion ( p ), the rotated point ( p&rsquo; ) is obtained as:
$$
p&rsquo; = q p q^{-1}.
$$</p></li></ul><p>Using quaternions avoids issues like gimbal lock and allows smooth, efficient calculations, making them useful in robotic cube solvers and computer simulations.</p><h5 id="comparison-of-euclidean-and-quaternion-methods"><strong>Comparison of Euclidean and Quaternion Methods</strong></h5><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Advantages</th><th>Use Case in Rubik’s Cube</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rotation Matrices</strong></td><td>Simple, easy to compute</td><td>Manual cube manipulation, algebraic solving</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Quaternions</strong></td><td>No gimbal lock, computationally efficient</td><td>Robotics, computer simulations</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While human solvers primarily use group-theoretic approaches, understanding Euclidean and quaternion mathematics is valuable for computational methods and AI-driven solutions.</p><h4 id="advanced-mathematics-behind-the-rubiks-cube">Advanced Mathematics Behind the Rubik’s Cube</h4><h4 id="graph-theory-and-the-rubiks-cube"><strong>Graph Theory and the Rubik’s Cube</strong></h4><p>The entire state space of the Rubik’s Cube can be visualized as a<strong>graph</strong>, where:</p><ul><li>Each<strong>node</strong> represents a unique cube configuration.</li><li>Each<strong>edge</strong> represents a valid move between two configurations.</li></ul><p>This allows us to analyze cube solving as a<strong>shortest path problem</strong> (like in Dijkstra’s algorithm). The challenge is that this graph is<strong>huge</strong>, containing about<strong>43 quintillion nodes</strong>! Researchers have used<strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</strong> to explore how quickly the cube can be solved from any state, leading to the proof of<strong>God’s Number</strong> (20 in QTM).</p><h4 id="markov-chains-and-random-scrambles"><strong>Markov Chains and Random Scrambles</strong></h4><p>If you randomly twist a Rubik’s Cube, how many moves does it take before it is &ldquo;fully scrambled&rdquo;? This is a classic<strong>Markov Chain</strong> problem, where each move represents a<strong>random transition</strong> between states. Studies suggest that after about<strong>19-20 random moves</strong>, the cube is statistically close to a uniformly random state. This insight is used in competitive cubing to ensure fairness in official scramble generation.</p><h4 id="group-structure-conjugacy-classes-and-commutators"><strong>Group Structure: Conjugacy Classes and Commutators</strong></h4><p>The Rubik’s Cube group has special elements called<strong>commutators</strong> and<strong>conjugates</strong>, which are fundamental to advanced solving techniques:</p><ul><li><strong>Commutator</strong>: ([A, B] = A B A^{-1} B^{-1}) – used in many algorithms to isolate cube pieces.</li><li><strong>Conjugate</strong>: (X A X^{-1}) – applies a transformation in a different context.</li></ul><p>These concepts allow cube solvers to move a small set of pieces without disrupting the rest, forming the basis for algorithms like<strong>CFOP, Roux, and ZZ methods</strong>.</p><h4 id="why-is-solving-the-cube-hard-computational-complexity"><strong>Why Is Solving the Cube Hard? Computational Complexity</strong></h4><p>Solving an<strong>arbitrary</strong> cube position optimally (in the least moves) is an<strong>NP-hard problem</strong>. That means there is no known efficient algorithm that can solve every case optimally in polynomial time. This is why human solvers use heuristic-based approaches like<strong>CFOP, Petrus, and Roux</strong>, rather than brute force computation.</p><h4 id="whats-next-computers-and-efficient-cube-solving"><strong>What’s Next? Computers and Efficient Cube Solving</strong></h4><p>In our next post, we will explore how<strong>computers</strong> approach solving the Rubik’s Cube, including AI techniques, heuristics, and optimal solvers like<strong>Kociemba’s Algorithm and DeepCubeA</strong>.</p>

Whether you&rsquo;re aiming for speed, efficiency, or ergonomic moves, the CFOP, Roux, and ZZ methods offer distinct paths to mastery. These are all speed-solving methods designed for competitive cubing, but there are also beginner-friendly and alternative approaches like the Layer-by-Layer (LBL) and Petrus methods.</p><hr><h4 id="cfop-the-classic-speedcubing-approach">CFOP: The Classic Speedcubing Approach</h4><p>CFOP (Cross – First Two Layers – Orientation of Last Layer – Permutation of Last Layer), also known as the Fridrich Method, is the most widely used method among speedcubers. It breaks the solve into four logical steps, enabling high efficiency and minimal pause between sequences.</p><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="360" src="/images/post/solverubcub/cfop_hu7945380640516140194.webp" alt="pieces-of-rubiks-cube" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/post\/solverubcub\/cfop_hu7604892347410183553.jpg'"/><script>
window.addEventListener("load", (e) => {
const lightbox = GLightbox();
});</script><h5 id="the-cross">The Cross</h5><p>The first step is solving a cross on one face of the cube, typically white. The aim is to position the four edge pieces correctly while minimizing moves. Advanced solvers focus on efficiency, ensuring that each edge is inserted optimally without unnecessary cube rotations. Many speedcubers practice solving the cross in eight moves or fewer to optimize their solving time.</p><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="563" src="/images/post/solverubcub/cross_hu8167784418912384101.webp" alt="pieces-of-rubiks-cube" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/post\/solverubcub\/cross_hu8167784418912384101.webp'"/><h5 id="first-two-layers-f2l">First Two Layers (F2L)</h5><p>Rather than solving corners and edges separately, F2L pairs them up before inserting them into their respective slots. This is a crucial speed improvement over beginner methods, reducing move count significantly. F2L can be learned intuitively, but advanced cubers memorize key cases and algorithms for increased efficiency.</p><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="563" src="/images/post/solverubcub/f2l_hu8826165599237415008.webp" alt="pieces-of-rubiks-cube" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/post\/solverubcub\/f2l_hu8826165599237415008.webp'"/><h5 id="orientation-of-the-last-layer-oll">Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL)</h5><p>Once the first two layers are completed, the next step is orienting all pieces on the top layer so that the face becomes a uniform color. There are 57 possible cases, but beginners can use a two-step OLL approach with just ten algorithms.</p><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="563" src="/images/post/solverubcub/oll_hu17659736153421577177.webp" alt="pieces-of-rubiks-cube" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/post\/solverubcub\/oll_hu17659736153421577177.webp'"/><h5 id="permutation-of-the-last-layer-pll">Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL)</h5><p>The final step is to permute the last layer pieces into their correct positions. This step requires knowledge of 21 algorithms in the full PLL method or just six in the two-look PLL approach. Mastering PLL allows for faster transition times and optimized finger tricks to reduce execution delays.</p><p>CFOP is the go-to method for many speedcubers because of its structured approach and ability to handle high turn-per-second (TPS) solves with ease. Even I use CFOP for solving the cube now—I do an intuitive cross and F2L, then use 2-look OLL and 1-look PLL.</p><p>For 2x2, I use the CLL (Corners Last Layer) method. You can check out my times here:<a href="https://events.cubelelo.com/profile/24CLMUM001" target="_blank">Cubelelo Profile</a> (it&rsquo;s unofficial, but yeah!).</p><hr><h4 id="roux-the-efficient-block-building-method">Roux: The Efficient Block-Building Method</h4><p>Roux, developed by Gilles Roux in 2003, takes a vastly different approach from CFOP. It focuses on reducing move count and minimizing cube rotations, making it ideal for one-handed solving. Unlike CFOP, Roux relies heavily on intuitive solving techniques and block-building rather than strict algorithm memorization.</p><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="563" src="/images/post/solverubcub/roux_hu17826746158529360042.webp" alt="pieces-of-rubiks-cube" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/post\/solverubcub\/roux_hu17826746158529360042.webp'"/><h5 id="first-block">First Block</h5><p>The solve begins by constructing a 1x2x3 block on one side of the cube. This is done by strategically placing the edge and corner pieces in the correct positions without disrupting already solved parts.</p><h5 id="second-block">Second Block</h5><p>A second 1x2x3 block is then built on the opposite side of the cube. At this point, the left and right blocks are complete, leaving only the middle slice and top layer unsolved.</p><h5 id="cmll-corner-orientation--permutation">CMLL (Corner Orientation &amp; Permutation)</h5><p>Instead of solving the last layer in steps like OLL and PLL, Roux addresses all four corners at once using CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer). This step requires only 42 algorithms but can be broken into smaller subsets for easier learning.</p><h5 id="lse-last-six-edges">LSE (Last Six Edges)</h5><p>The final stage focuses on solving the remaining six edges using M and U moves exclusively. This step is what makes Roux unique, as it avoids rotations and allows for smooth, fast execution.</p><p>The strength of Roux lies in its efficiency—solves often require fewer moves than CFOP, and its reliance on intuitive solving makes it an excellent alternative for those who prefer a different approach.</p><hr><h4 id="zz-the-method-designed-for-ergonomics">ZZ: The Method Designed for Ergonomics</h4><p>The ZZ method, named after its creator Zbigniew Zborowski, aims to balance efficiency and turning ergonomics. It pre-orients edges early in the solve, allowing the rest of the cube to be solved with only R, U, and L moves, eliminating cube rotations and awkward finger placements.</p><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="563" src="/images/post/solverubcub/zz_hu17756769075213033669.webp" alt="pieces-of-rubiks-cube" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/post\/solverubcub\/zz_hu17756769075213033669.webp'"/><h5 id="eoline-edge-orientation--line">EOLine (Edge Orientation &amp; Line)</h5><p>The solve begins by orienting all edges while placing two key edges along the bottom. This setup ensures that later steps can be executed smoothly without disrupting edge orientation.</p><h5 id="first-two-layers-f2l-1">First Two Layers (F2L)</h5><p>Unlike CFOP, which requires cube rotations for F2L, the ZZ method allows for rotationless F2L execution. Because edge orientation was handled in EOLine, all remaining F2L pairs can be inserted using only R, U, and L moves.</p><h5 id="last-layer">Last Layer</h5><p>Since all edges are already oriented, solving the last layer can be approached using CFOP-style algorithms or ZZ-specific techniques. The most advanced ZZ solvers use ZBLL (Zborowski-Bruchem Last Layer), which solves the entire last layer in one step, requiring knowledge of over 400 algorithms.</p><p>ZZ is an excellent choice for solvers who want to improve ergonomics while maintaining low move counts. However, EOLine can be challenging to master, making it slightly more difficult for beginners compared to CFOP.</p><hr><h4 id="layer-by-layer-lbl-the-beginner-friendly-method">Layer-by-Layer (LBL): The Beginner-Friendly Method</h4><p>The Layer-by-Layer (LBL) method is the most common beginner method. It involves solving the cube in three distinct layers:</p><ol><li>Solve the<strong>first layer</strong> by completing a cross and inserting corners.</li><li>Solve the<strong>second layer</strong> by inserting edge pieces into their correct slots.</li><li>Solve the<strong>last layer</strong> using algorithms to orient and permute the pieces.</li></ol><p>This method is easy to learn and provides a solid foundation for more advanced techniques like CFOP.</p><hr><h4 id="petrus-method-the-block-building-alternative">Petrus Method: The Block-Building Alternative</h4><p>The Petrus Method, developed by Lars Petrus, is a block-building approach that reduces move count and improves efficiency:</p><ol><li>Solve a<strong>2x2x2 block</strong> anywhere on the cube.</li><li>Expand it to a<strong>2x2x3 block</strong>.</li><li><strong>Orient the edges</strong> early to make solving easier.</li><li>Solve the<strong>remaining pieces</strong> with minimal moves.</li></ol><p>This method is useful for those who want an alternative to CFOP and prefer a more flexible solving approach.</p><hr><h4 id="choosing-the-right-method">Choosing the Right Method</h4><p>Each method has its strengths, and the best one depends on your goals:</p><ul><li><strong>CFOP</strong> is the best choice for speedcubers aiming for high TPS and efficiency.</li><li><strong>Roux</strong> is ideal for solvers who prefer intuitive solving and minimal rotations.</li><li><strong>ZZ</strong> is suited for those who want ergonomic solves with fewer rotations.</li><li><strong>LBL</strong> is great for beginners starting with the cube.</li><li><strong>Petrus</strong> is perfect for those who enjoy a block-building approach.</li></ul><p>No matter which method you choose, improving your lookahead, finger tricks, and efficiency will always be key to becoming a faster solver. Try out different approaches and see what works best for you!</p><p>Happy cubing!</p>

The core mechanism allows for smooth rotations, holding everything together while letting the outer pieces move freely.</p><p>The cube consists of three main types of pieces:</p><ul><li><strong>Core:</strong> The core holds the entire structure intact. It consists of six fixed center pieces that never move relative to each other.</li><li><strong>Edges:</strong> The cube has<strong>12 edge pieces</strong>, each with two colors, positioned between the centers.</li><li><strong>Corners:</strong> There are<strong>8 corner pieces</strong>, each with three colors, which determine the cube’s orientation.</li></ul><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="743" src="/images/post/rubcubemech/image_hu9050823026402286148.webp" alt="pieces-of-rubiks-cube" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/post\/rubcubemech\/image_hu9077097627081541973.png'"/><script>

Think about the Rubik’s Cube, where both hemispheres of your brain are engaged. The left brain loves the logical sequences and patterns, while the right brain enjoys the spatial awareness and creativity. It’s like a full-brain workout.</p><p>Physical puzzles improve hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and your ability to multitask. Plus, there’s something incredibly satisfying about manipulating an object and watching it transform under your hands. For me, working with physical puzzles has always been a humbling experience—you can’t brute force them; they demand focus and finesse.</p><hr><h4 id="the-rubiks-cube-a-personal-journey">The Rubik’s Cube: A Personal Journey</h4><p>Ah, the Rubik’s Cube—a classic that’s equal parts intriguing and intimidating. My first encounter with it was… chaotic, to say the least. Scrambling it was easy, but solving it? Let’s just say it took me more than a few attempts (and some YouTube tutorials) to get it right.</p><p>But once I did, it was magical. Solving a Rubik’s Cube is a dance of logic and intuition. It teaches you to think in layers, anticipate moves, and stay calm under pressure. And honestly, it’s just plain cool to whip one out and solve it in front of friends.</p><hr><h4 id="puzzles-meet-tech-the-rubiks-cube-solver">Puzzles Meet Tech: The Rubik’s Cube Solver</h4><p>Now imagine combining the worlds of physical and digital puzzles. That’s exactly what we’ll be doing in the<strong>Rubik’s Cube Solver</strong> series.

From understanding the cube’s mechanics to writing algorithms that optimize solutions, this project is as rewarding as it is complex. And here’s the best part: you’ll get to learn and build alongside me.</p><p><em>Note</em>: This project is still in its simulation phase. There are optimizations to be made, and the hardware implementation is yet to be completed. But that’s the beauty of this series—we’ll question every step, learn from every mistake, and inch closer to the solution together.</p><hr><h4 id="introducing-the-pid-series">Introducing the PID Series</h4><p>The Rubik’s Cube Solver is just the beginning. The<strong>PID: Project IN Detail</strong> series is a deep dive into my projects, where I share insights, challenges, and breakthroughs. There’s a lot more to come, and I’m thrilled to have you along for the ride.</p><p>In the next few posts, we’ll start with the basics of solving a Rubik’s Cube—the foundational techniques that will help you tackle the puzzle manually. From there, we’ll explore how computers can do it better, faster, and with optimizations we can only dream of.</p><hr><h4 id="why-wait-lets-get-started">Why Wait? Let’s Get Started!</h4><p>Puzzles are more than a pastime; they’re a way of thinking, learning, and growing. Whether you’re a coding enthusiast, a Rubik’s Cube aficionado, or just someone who loves a good challenge, this series has something for you.</p><p>So grab a cube, roll up your sleeves, and let’s dive into the fascinating world of puzzles—one twist at a time.</p>

SPI. It operates using just two wires, like asynchronous serial, yet
supports communication with up to 1,008 peripheral devices. Unlike SPI,
I2C accommodates multi-controller systems, allowing more than one
controller to communicate with all peripheral devices on the bus
(although the controllers must take turns using the bus lines).</p><p>I2C data rates fall between those of asynchronous serial and SPI, with
most devices communicating at 100 kHz or 400 kHz. While there is some
overhead&mdash;requiring one additional acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) bit for
every 8 bits of data transmitted&mdash;I2C remains efficient. Although
implementing I2C requires more complex hardware than SPI, it is still
simpler than asynchronous serial and can be easily realized in software.</p><figure id="fig:i2c_block_diagram"><span class="image placeholder" data-original-image-src="i2c_block_diagram.png" data-original-image-title="" width="80%"/><figcaption>Block Diagram of an I2C System</figcaption></figure><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="600" src="/images/projects/i2cv/i2c_block_diagram_hu9724975040744162600.webp" alt="Block Diagram of an I2C System" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/i2cv\/i2c_block_diagram_hu8969938300534542992.png'"/><script>

devices on the bus. These two lines facilitate<strong>bidirectional,
half-duplex communication</strong>. I2C supports multiple controllers and
multiple target devices, making it a flexible choice for various
applications. It is essential to use<strong>pull-up resistors</strong> on both of
these lines to ensure proper operation. Fig<a href="#fig:i2c_implementation">2.4</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:i2c_implementation&rdquo;} shows a typical implementation of
the I2C physical layer.</p><figure id="fig:i2c_implementation"><span class="image placeholder" data-original-image-src="i2c_physical_layer.png" data-original-image-title="" width="80%"/><figcaption>Typical I2C Implementation</figcaption></figure><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="377" src="/images/projects/i2cv/i2c_physical_layer_hu5001890849971727351.webp" alt="Typical I2C Implementation" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/i2cv\/i2c_physical_layer_hu5413651912767855860.png'"/><p>One of the main reasons that I2C is a widely adopted protocol is due to
its requirement of only<strong>two lines</strong> for communication. The first line,<strong>SCL</strong>, is the serial clock line, primarily controlled by the
controller device. SCL is responsible for synchronously clocking data in
or out of the target device. The second line,<strong>SDA</strong>, is the serial
data line, used to transmit data to or from the target devices. For
instance, a controller device can send configuration data and output
codes to a target<strong>digital-to-analog converter (DAC)</strong>, or a target<strong>analog-to-digital converter (ADC)</strong> can send conversion data back to
the controller device.</p><p>I2C operates as a<strong>half-duplex communication</strong> protocol, meaning that
only one controller or target device can send data on the bus at any
given time. In contrast, the<strong>Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)</strong> is a<strong>full-duplex protocol</strong> that allows data to be sent and received
simultaneously, requiring four lines for communication: two data lines
for sending and receiving data, along with a serial clock and a unique
SPI chip select line to select the device for communication.</p><p>An I2C controller device initiates and terminates communication, which
eliminates potential issues related to<strong>bus contention</strong>. Communication
with a target device is established through a<strong>unique address</strong> on the
bus, allowing multiple controllers and multiple target devices to
coexist on the I2C bus.</p><p>The SDA and SCL lines have an<strong>open-drain connection</strong> to all devices
on the bus, necessitating a pull-up resistor connected to a common
voltage supply.</p><h5 id="open-drain-connection">Open-Drain Connection</h5><p>The<strong>open-drain connections</strong> are employed on both the SDA and SCL
lines and are linked to an NMOS transistor. This open-drain
configuration manages the I2C communication line by either pulling the
line low or allowing it to rise to a high state. The term "open-drain"
refers to the NMOS bus connection when the NMOS is turned<strong>OFF</strong>.

transistor is either switched<strong>ON</strong> or<strong>OFF</strong>. When the NMOS is<strong>ON</strong>, it allows current to flow through the resistor to ground,
effectively pulling the open-drain line low. This transition from high
to low is typically rapid, as the NMOS quickly discharges any
capacitance on the SDA or SCL lines.</p><p>When the NMOS turns<strong>OFF</strong>, the device ceases to pull current, and the
pull-up resistor subsequently raises the SDA or SCL line back to<strong>VDD</strong>. Figure<a href="#fig:open_drain_off">2.6</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;

the line is pulled up against the bus capacitance, rather than being
actively driven high.</p><h4 id="i2c-protocol">I2C Protocol</h4><p>Communication over<strong>I2C</strong> requires a specific signaling protocol to
ensure that devices on the bus recognize valid I2C transmissions. While
this process is more intricate than<strong>UART</strong> or<strong>SPI</strong>, most
I2C-compatible devices handle the finer protocol details internally,
allowing developers to focus primarily on data exchange.</p><p><strong>SDA and SCL Lines:</strong> The I2C bus operates with two main lines:<strong>SDA</strong>
(Serial Data Line) and<strong>SCL</strong> (Serial Clock Line). Data is transmitted
over the<strong>SDA</strong> line in sync with clock pulses on the<strong>SCL</strong> line.
Generally, data is placed on<strong>SDA</strong> when<strong>SCL</strong> is low, and devices
sample this data when<strong>SCL</strong> goes high. If needed, multiple internal<strong>registers</strong> may control data handling, especially in complex devices.</p><p><strong>Protocol Components:</strong></p><p>1.<strong>Start Condition:</strong> To initiate communication, the controller sets<strong>SCL</strong> high and then pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low. This signals all peripheral
devices on the bus that a transmission is starting. In cases where
multiple controllers attempt to start communication simultaneously, the
first device to pull<strong>SDA</strong> low gains control. If necessary, the
controller can issue repeated start conditions to maintain bus control
without releasing it.</p><p>2.<strong>Address Frame:</strong> Every I2C transmission begins with an<strong>address
frame</strong> to specify the target peripheral. This frame consists of a 7-bit
address, sent<strong>MSB</strong> (most significant bit) first, followed by a<strong>R/W
bit</strong> indicating the operation type (read or write).</p><p>After this, the 9th bit, known as the<strong>ACK/NACK bit</strong>, is used by the
receiving device to confirm reception. If the device pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low
before the 9th clock pulse (<strong>ACK</strong>), communication continues. If not
(<strong>NACK</strong>), it indicates either unrecognized data or an issue in
reception, prompting the controller to decide the next steps.</p><p>3.<strong>Data Frames:</strong> Following the address frame, one or more<strong>data
frames</strong> are sent over the<strong>SDA</strong> line. Each data frame is 8 bits, and
data is transferred from the controller to the peripheral or vice versa,
based on the<strong>R/W bit</strong> in the address frame.</p><p>Many peripheral devices have auto-incrementing<strong>internal registers</strong>,
enabling data to continue from consecutive registers without the need to
re-specify the register address.</p><p>4.<strong>Stop Condition:</strong> The controller ends communication by generating
a<strong>stop condition</strong>. This is done by transitioning<strong>SDA</strong> from low to
high after a high-to-low transition on<strong>SCL</strong>, with<strong>SCL</strong> held high
during the stop sequence. To avoid false stop conditions, the value on<strong>SDA</strong> should not change while<strong>SCL</strong> is high during regular data
transmission.</p><p>The<strong>I2C protocol</strong> divides communication into structured<strong>frames</strong>.
Each communication sequence begins with a<strong>START</strong> condition, initiated
by the controller, followed by an<strong>address frame</strong> and then one or more<strong>data frames</strong>. Every frame also includes an acknowledgment (ACK) bit,
signaling that the frame has been received successfully by the intended
device.<strong>Figure 3-3</strong> illustrates the structure of two I2C
communication frames, showing both address and data frames in detail.</p><figure id="fig:i2c_frames"><span class="image placeholder" data-original-image-src="i2c_frames.png" data-original-image-title="" width="80%"/><figcaption>I2C Address and Data Frames</figcaption></figure><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="214" src="/images/projects/i2cv/i2c_frames_hu8079952379911720152.webp" alt="I2C Address and Data Frames" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/i2cv\/i2c_frames_hu17776359726810003991.png'"/><p>In an I2C transaction, the controller first sends a<strong>START condition</strong>
by pulling the<strong>SDA</strong> line low, followed by the<strong>SCL</strong> line. This
sequence asserts control over the bus, preventing other devices from
interfering. Each target device on the I2C bus has a unique<strong>7-bit
address</strong>, allowing the controller to specify which target device it
intends to communicate with.</p><p>Once the address is set on<strong>SDA</strong> while<strong>SCL</strong> acts as the clock, the<strong>8th bit</strong> (R/W bit) indicates the intended operation type:<strong>read
(1)</strong> or<strong>write (0)</strong>. This initial address and R/W bit are followed by
an<strong>ACK bit</strong>, sent by the target device to confirm receipt. If the
target device receives the address successfully, it pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low
during the next<strong>SCL</strong> pulse, signaling an ACK. If no device
acknowledges, the line remains high, signaling a<strong>NACK</strong>.</p><p>After the address frame, one or more<strong>data frames</strong> follow. Each data
frame contains 8 bits of data, which are acknowledged (ACK) in the 9th
bit. If the data frame is a<strong>write</strong> operation, the target device pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low to confirm data receipt. For<strong>read</strong> operations, the
controller pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low to acknowledge receipt of the data. The
presence or absence of the ACK is essential for troubleshooting, as a
missing ACK may indicate an addressing error or transmission failure.</p><p>Finally, the communication ends with a<strong>STOP condition</strong>, where the
controller releases<strong>SCL</strong> first, followed by<strong>SDA</strong>. This action
releases the I2C bus for other devices to use, completing the
communication cycle.</p><p>This structured protocol allows for the transmission of multiple bytes
within one communication sequence. In cases where a target device has
multiple internal<strong>registers</strong>, a write operation can specify the
register to read or write data to, enhancing flexibility and enabling
complex data transactions.</p><h1 id="module-specifications">Module Specifications</h1><h4 id="master-module">MASTER MODULE</h4><h5 id="c0d3">C0d3</h5><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"

code is a Verilog implementation of an I2C Master Module.
This module enables communication with I2C-compatible devices through
the I2C protocol by implementing the necessary operations to generate
I2C signals and manage data transfer. Let&rsquo;s break down each section of
the code:</p><h6 id="module-declaration">Module Declaration</h6><p>The code begins with the module declaration:</p><blockquote><pre><code>module i2c_master(
input wire clk, // System clock
input wire rst, // Synchronous reset
input wire [6:0] addr, // 7-bit I2C address
input wire [7:0] data_in, // Data to be transmitted
input wire enable, // Enable signal to start I2C transaction
input wire rw, // Read/Write control (0 = Write, 1 = Read)
output reg [7:0] data_out, // Data received from I2C
output wire ready, // Ready signal when module is idle
inout i2c_sda, // I2C data line (SDA)
inout wire i2c_scl // I2C clock line (SCL)
);</code></pre></blockquote><p>This module contains inputs for the system clock (<code>clk</code>), reset (<code>rst</code>),
I2C address (<code>addr</code>), data to be sent (<code>data_in</code>), an enable signal
(<code>enable</code>), and a Read/Write control (<code>rw</code>). It also provides outputs
for data received (<code>data_out</code>), a ready status signal (<code>ready</code>), and
bidirectional I2C lines,<code>i2c_sda</code> and<code>i2c_scl</code>.</p><h6 id="state-machine-definition">State Machine Definition</h6><p>The code defines several states representing stages in the I2C
transaction:</p><blockquote><pre><code>localparam IDLE = 0;
localparam START = 1;
localparam ADDRESS = 2;
localparam READ_ACK = 3;
localparam WRITE_DATA = 4;
localparam WRITE_ACK = 5;
localparam READ_DATA = 6;
localparam READ_ACK2 = 7;
localparam STOP = 8;</code></pre></blockquote><p>Each<code>localparam</code> corresponds to a state in the Finite State Machine
(FSM), controlling the I2C protocol flow, including start, address
transmission, acknowledgment (ACK) reception, data transfer, and stop
condition generation.</p><h6 id="clock-divider">Clock Divider</h6><p>To generate a slower clock for the I2C operations, a clock divider is
implemented:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(posedge clk) begin
if (counter2 == (DIVIDE_BY / 2) - 1) begin
i2c_clk &lt;= ~i2c_clk;
counter2 &lt;= 0;
end else counter2 &lt;= counter2 + 1;
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>This block toggles<code>i2c_clk</code> at a lower frequency than the system clock,<code>clk</code>, using a counter<code>counter2</code> with a division factor defined by<code>DIVIDE_BY</code>.</p><h6 id="sda-and-scl-control">SDA and SCL Control</h6><p>To control the<code>i2c_sda</code> and<code>i2c_scl</code> lines based on the module&rsquo;s
state:</p><blockquote><pre><code>assign ready = ((rst == 0) &amp;&amp; (state == IDLE)) ? 1 : 0;
assign i2c_scl = (i2c_scl_enable == 0) ? 1 : i2c_clk;
assign i2c_sda = (write_enable == 1) ? sda_out : 'bz;</code></pre></blockquote><ul><li><p><code>ready</code> is high when the reset is inactive and the state is<code>IDLE</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>i2c_scl</code> is either high (idle state) or follows the divided<code>i2c_clk</code> signal.</p></li><li><p><code>i2c_sda</code> outputs the value of<code>sda_out</code> when<code>write_enable</code> is
active. When<code>write_enable</code> is inactive,<code>i2c_sda</code> goes to
high-impedance (<code>’bz</code>) for reading data.</p></li></ul><h6 id="finite-state-machine-fsm">Finite State Machine (FSM)</h6><p>The FSM controls the I2C communication process, progressing through
states based on the I2C protocol requirements:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(posedge i2c_clk or posedge rst) begin
if (rst == 1) begin
state &lt;= IDLE;
end else begin
case (state)
IDLE: begin
if (enable) begin
state &lt;= START;
saved_addr &lt;= {addr, rw};
saved_data &lt;= data_in;
end
end
START: begin
counter &lt;= 7;
state &lt;= ADDRESS;
end
...
STOP: begin
state &lt;= IDLE;
end
endcase
end
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>Each state corresponds to an I2C operation:</p><ul><li><p><code>IDLE</code>: Waits for<code>enable</code> signal to initiate communication.</p></li><li><p><code>START</code>: Prepares a start condition by asserting<code>sda_out</code> low.</p></li><li><p><code>ADDRESS</code>: Sends the address and R/W bit.</p></li><li><p><code>READ_ACK</code> and<code>READ_ACK2</code>: Verifies acknowledgment (ACK) from the
slave.</p></li><li><p><code>WRITE_DATA</code> and<code>WRITE_ACK</code>: Transfers data to the slave and waits
for ACK.</p></li><li><p><code>READ_DATA</code>: Receives data from the slave.</p></li><li><p><code>STOP</code>: Generates a stop condition and returns to<code>IDLE</code>.</p></li></ul><h6 id="sda-output-logic">SDA Output Logic</h6><p>The logic for controlling the<code>i2c_sda</code> line, depending on the FSM
state, is implemented as follows:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(negedge i2c_clk or posedge rst) begin
if (rst == 1) begin
write_enable &lt;= 1;
sda_out &lt;= 1;
end else begin
case (state)
START: begin
write_enable &lt;= 1;
sda_out &lt;= 0;
end
ADDRESS: begin
sda_out &lt;= saved_addr[counter];
end
...
STOP: begin
write_enable &lt;= 1;
sda_out &lt;= 1;
end
endcase
end
end</code></pre></blockquote><ul><li><p>In the<code>START</code> state,<code>sda_out</code> goes low to generate a start
condition.</p></li><li><p>In the<code>ADDRESS</code> and<code>WRITE_DATA</code> states,<code>sda_out</code> sends the bits
of<code>saved_addr</code> or<code>saved_data</code>.</p></li><li><p>In<code>STOP</code>,<code>sda_out</code> goes high to signify the end of the
transmission.</p></li></ul><p>This Verilog module effectively implements an I2C Master communication
sequence by controlling the<code>i2c_sda</code> and<code>i2c_scl</code> lines according to
the I2C protocol.</p><h4 id="slave-module">SLAVE MODULE</h4><h5 id="c0d3-1">C0d3</h5><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"

id="explanation-1">Explanation</h5><p>The Verilog code presented is for an I2C Slave Module that implements
the core logic for an I2C slave device capable of receiving and
transmitting data over the I2C protocol. Let&rsquo;s break down the components
of the code and their functionality:</p><h6 id="module-declaration-1">Module Declaration</h6><p>The module begins with the declaration of inputs and outputs:</p><blockquote><pre><code>module i2c_slave(
input [6:0] addr_in, // Dynamic address input for I2C slave
inout sda, // I2C data line (SDA)
inout scl // I2C clock line (SCL)
);</code></pre></blockquote><p>The inputs include a 7-bit address (<code>addr_in</code>) for the slave device,
along with the bidirectional<code>sda</code> and<code>scl</code> lines for data and clock
signals respectively.</p><h6 id="state-machine-definition-1">State Machine Definition</h6><p>The I2C protocol relies on a finite state machine (FSM) to control the
data transfer sequence. The FSM is represented by five states:</p><blockquote><pre><code>localparam READ_ADDR = 0;
localparam SEND_ACK = 1;
localparam READ_DATA = 2;
localparam WRITE_DATA = 3;
localparam SEND_ACK2 = 4;</code></pre></blockquote><p>Each state corresponds to a particular phase of the I2C communication: -<code>READ_ADDR</code>: Reads the I2C address and R/W bit. -<code>SEND_ACK</code>: Sends
acknowledgment (ACK) if the address matches. -<code>READ_DATA</code>: Receives
data from the master. -<code>WRITE_DATA</code>: Sends data to the master. -<code>SEND_ACK2</code>: Sends a second ACK after data reception.</p><h6 id="internal-registers-and-signals">Internal Registers and Signals</h6><p>Several internal registers and signals are declared to support the
functionality of the I2C slave: -<code>addr</code> holds the slave address and R/W
bit. -<code>counter</code> is used to count bits during transmission. -<code>state</code>
holds the current FSM state. -<code>data_in</code> and<code>data_out</code> store the
incoming and outgoing data, respectively. -<code>sda_out</code> and<code>sda_in</code>
control the data line (SDA). -<code>start</code> flags the detection of the I2C
start condition. -<code>write_enable</code> controls whether the slave can drive
the SDA line.</p><h6 id="sda-line-control">SDA Line Control</h6><p>The assignment of the<code>sda</code> line is conditional on the<code>write_enable</code>
signal:</p><blockquote><pre><code>assign sda = (write_enable == 1) ? sda_out : 'bz;</code></pre></blockquote><p>This means that the slave drives the<code>sda</code> line when<code>write_enable</code> is
active, otherwise, the line is in high-impedance state (&lsquo;bz).</p><h6 id="start-and-stop-condition-detection">Start and Stop Condition Detection</h6><p>The start condition is detected when there is a falling edge on the<code>sda</code> line while the<code>scl</code> line is high, and the stop condition is
detected when there is a rising edge on the<code>sda</code> line while<code>scl</code> is
high. These conditions trigger transitions in the FSM.</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(negedge sda) begin
if ((start == 0) &amp;&amp; (scl == 1)) begin
start &lt;= 1; // Set start flag
counter &lt;= 7; // Initialize bit counter
end
end
always @(posedge sda) begin
if ((start == 1) &amp;&amp; (scl == 1)) begin
state &lt;= READ_ADDR; // Transition to READ_ADDR state
start &lt;= 0; // Reset start flag
write_enable &lt;= 0; // Disable write
end
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>These blocks capture the start and stop conditions and manage the FSM
transitions accordingly.</p><h6 id="fsm-logic-for-data-transfer">FSM Logic for Data Transfer</h6><p>The FSM operates on the rising edge of the<code>scl</code> signal, progressing
through various states based on the detected conditions:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(posedge scl) begin
if (start == 1) begin
case(state)
READ_ADDR: begin
addr[counter] &lt;= sda;
if(counter == 0) state &lt;= SEND_ACK;
else counter &lt;= counter - 1;
end
SEND_ACK: begin
if(addr[7:1] == addr_in) begin
counter &lt;= 7;
if(addr[0] == 0) begin
state &lt;= READ_DATA; // If write mode, move to READ_DATA
end else state &lt;= WRITE_DATA; // Else move to WRITE_DATA
end else state &lt;= READ_ADDR;
end
...
endcase
end
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>The state transitions depend on whether the address matches, the R/W
bit, and whether data is being read or written. The<code>SEND_ACK</code> state
sends an acknowledgment if the address is correct, while the<code>READ_DATA</code>
and<code>WRITE_DATA</code> states handle data reception and transmission
respectively.</p><h6 id="sda-output-logic-1">SDA Output Logic</h6><p>The logic for controlling the<code>sda</code> output during the FSM states is
defined in the following block:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(negedge scl) begin
case(state)
READ_ADDR: begin
write_enable &lt;= 0; // Disable writing during address read
end
SEND_ACK: begin
sda_out &lt;= (addr[7:1] == addr_in) ? 0 : 1; // Send ACK (0) or NACK (1)
write_enable &lt;= 1;
end
READ_DATA: begin
write_enable &lt;= 0; // Disable writing during data read
end
WRITE_DATA: begin
sda_out &lt;= data_out[counter]; // Output data bit by bit
write_enable &lt;= 1;
end
SEND_ACK2: begin
sda_out &lt;= 0; // Send ACK (0) after data reception
write_enable &lt;= 1;
end
endcase
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>Each state manipulates the<code>sda_out</code> signal to either send an
acknowledgment (ACK) or transmit the data bit by bit. The<code>SEND_ACK</code>
state checks the address match and sends either an ACK or NACK. The<code>WRITE_DATA</code> state sends the data, while the<code>SEND_ACK2</code> state sends an
ACK after data reception.</p><h6 id="summary">Summary</h6><p>This Verilog code implements a simple I2C Slave module that can handle
basic I2C communication. It includes start/stop condition detection,
address matching, data reception, and data transmission using an FSM.
The module can receive data from the I2C master, send data to it, and
properly acknowledge the master at each step in the communication
process.</p><h4 id="top-level-module">TOP-LEVEL MODULE</h4><h5 id="c0d3-2">C0d3</h5><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-verilog" data-lang="verilog"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">`timescale</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>ns<span style="color:#f92672">/</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>ps</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span/></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// Top module to integrate i2c_master and i2c_slave</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// Top module to integrate i2c_master and i2c_slave</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">module</span> top(</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">input</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> clk,<span style="color:#75715e">// System clock</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">input</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> rst,<span style="color:#75715e">// Reset signal</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">input</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">6</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>] addr,<span style="color:#75715e">// 7-bit I2C address for the master to communicate with</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">input</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>] data_in,<span style="color:#75715e">// Data to be sent from the master to the slave</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">input</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> enable,<span style="color:#75715e">// Enable signal to initiate I2C communication</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">input</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> rw,<span style="color:#75715e">// Read/Write signal (0 = Write, 1 = Read)</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">output</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> [<span style="color:#ae81ff">7</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>] data_out,<span style="color:#75715e">// Data received by the master from the slave</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">output</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> ready,<span style="color:#75715e">// Signal indicating the master is ready for a new operation</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"/><span style="color:#66d9ef">inout</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">wire</span> i2c_sda,<span style="color:#75715e">// I2C data line (SDA) -

This successful transmission and receipt of data verify correct read functionality with an address match.</p><h3 id="challenges-and-risk-analysis">Challenges and Risk Analysis</h3><h4 id="potential-issues-and-solutions">Potential Issues and Solutions</h4><p>In the development of the I2C communication project, I encountered several challenges, starting with the design of basic Verilog modules for both master and slave entities capable of fundamental read and write operations. After an initial review of the I2C protocol from various online resources and Verilog syntax, I designed a preliminary testbench module to simulate and validate the basic functionality.</p><p>As the project progressed, I introduced additional functionality, including ACK and NACK flags, to handle incorrect slave addresses and refined the finite state machine (FSM) logic for more reliable state transitions. To make the slave module independent of global configurations, I designed a top-level module that instantiated both the master and slave modules and added an extra layer of address validation.</p><p>For synchronization, I implemented clock stretching between address and data frames. This addition worked effectively during address transmission but revealed timing issues during data frame read operations. After extensive troubleshooting, I identified limitations in the initial approach and modified the design accordingly.</p><p>I also explored a multi-master, multi-slave configuration, assigning slave addresses in the format<code>10101XY</code> (with<code>XY</code> values as 00, 01, 10, and 11 for slaves 1 through 4) and a master select line in the testbench to choose the active master. Preloaded data in each slave was structured as<code>110011XY</code> to streamline read operations. However, unresolved synchronization issues in the multi-master setup led me to scale back to a single-master, single-slave model, excluding clock stretching and multiple nodes. The final design focuses on single-point communication, with code attempts for the multi-master setup included in the project appendix on GitHub.</p><h4 id="risk-management">Risk Management</h4><p>Several potential risks emerged during the design and integration phases:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Design Complexity</strong>: The complexity of the I2C protocol and multi-node configuration posed unforeseen design challenges. A modular testing approach mitigated these risks by allowing iterative refinements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Timing Issues</strong>: Timing mismatches, particularly in multi-master configurations, impacted protocol accuracy. While resolved in the single-master model, this remains an area for future improvement.</p></li><li><p><strong>FSM Complexity</strong>: Introducing ACK/NACK handling increased the complexity of the FSM, raising the potential for state transition errors. Comprehensive simulation and debugging minimized these risks.</p></li></ul><p>In this project, I implemented the clock stretching functionality and addressed timing issues in data frame read operations. Starting with basic I2C modules, I managed the synchronization aspect by incorporating clock stretching between address and data frames, a mechanism crucial for addressing timing issues in the protocol. Despite progress, some discrepancies remain in the data frame during read operations, which are planned for future enhancements.</p><p>Additionally, I expanded the basic modules by introducing acknowledgment (ACK) and negative acknowledgment (NACK) flags to handle erroneous addresses. I refined the FSM logic to improve state transitions, address handling, and protocol management complexities. While the initial goal was a multi-master configuration with selectable slave nodes, unresolved timing issues led to a focus on a single-master, single-slave model, effectively capturing the core aspects of I2C communication in the final implementation.</p><h3 id="future-work-and-improvements">Future Work and Improvements</h3><h4 id="suggested-enhancements">Suggested Enhancements</h4><p>Future enhancements to this project could include adding more registers
to each slave, allowing for more sophisticated data handling. Additional
registers would enable more extensive data storage and retrieval options
in each slave device, making the project closer to real-world I2C
applications.</p><h4 id="alternative-designs">Alternative Designs</h4><p>Exploring alternative FSM architectures could improve the efficiency and
stability of the I2C protocol, especially for multi-master
configurations. Further, advanced data synchronization techniques,
possibly through modified clock stretching or data frame timing
adjustments, could address the current timing issues. Replacing the
current point-to-point master-slave setup with a robust multi-node
configuration, if resolved, could significantly enhance the protocol&rsquo;s
scalability.</p><h3 id="appendices">Appendices</h3><h4 id="verilog-code-listings">Verilog Code Listings</h4><p>The complete Verilog code for the I2C Master module, including support

That&rsquo;s when I thought:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Can image rotation be implemented using Verilog?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>This led me to experiment with basic transformations like rotation, cropping, translation, and shearing. As I explored further, I expanded the scope to include edge detection methods (Prewitt, Sobel, Kirsch Compass, Robinson Compass, and Canny) and noise reduction techniques (median, Gaussian, and box filters).</p><p>Initially, I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with the mathematical foundations of these techniques, so I learned them as I implemented each one. The project started as<strong>RoVer – Rotation using Verilog</strong>, focusing solely on image rotation. Over time, it evolved beyond simple transformations, leading to the creation of<strong>ImProVe – Image Processing Using Verilog</strong>.</p><h4 id="aim"><strong>Aim</strong></h4><p>The goal of this project is simple yet ambitious:<em>Build a set of foundational image processing blocks using Verilog that can be deployed on hardware for real-world applications.</em></p><p>These blocks will enable practical applications such as label detection, document scanning, object recognition, and more, making real-life automation and AI-driven vision tasks possible.</p><h6 id="the-challenge"><strong>THE Challenge</strong></h6><p><em>The project isn&rsquo;t just about implementing these techniques—it&rsquo;s about making them synthesizable for hardware.

A<strong>Boolean operation</strong> is then applied to remove irrelevant parts of the image that do not contain the document.</p></li><li><p>Next, corner detection is performed using the<strong>Moravec operator</strong> (as<strong>Harris</strong> is computationally expensive). Once the corners are identified,<strong>Bresenham&rsquo;s algorithm</strong> is used to draw lines connecting them, forming a quadrilateral around the document.</p></li><li><p>This quadrilateral is then mapped to a rectangle using<strong>homogeneous perspective transformation</strong>, followed by<strong>shearing</strong> and<strong>scaling</strong> operations if needed to refine the final output.</p></li></ul><p>OTW [Stuck at Bresenham&rsquo;s algorithm implementation]</p><h4 id="stereo-vision"><strong>Stereo Vision</strong></h4><ul><li><p>The process begins by converting the input stereo image pair from RGB to grayscale. Using the camera parameters, a<strong>disparity map</strong> is computed to determine the pixel shifts between the left and right images. This disparity information is then used to generate a<strong>depth map</strong>, which represents the distance of objects in the scene.</p></li><li><p>Both the disparity and depth map calculations are implemented entirely in Verilog, using text files for intermediate data storage and processing. Once the depth information is obtained, Python is used to continue the 3D reconstruction process, where the depth map is converted into a point cloud or a<strong>3D mesh representation</strong> for visualization.</p></li></ul><p>OTW [Accuracy of disparity and depth maps is low]</p><h4 id="mnist-digit-detection-never--improved"><strong>MNIST Digit Detection [NeVer ∩ ImProVeD]</strong></h4><ul><li><p>I implemented a simple neural network from scratch in<strong>Google Colab</strong> without using<strong>TensorFlow</strong> or<strong>Keras</strong>, relying solely on<strong>NumPy</strong> for numerical computations,<strong>Pandas</strong> for data handling, and<strong>Matplotlib</strong> for visualization. The dataset used was<strong>sample_data/mnist_train_small.csv</strong>, containing handwritten digit images in a flattened<strong>784-pixel format</strong>. Data preprocessing involved<strong>normalizing pixel values</strong> (dividing by<strong>255</strong>) and splitting it into a<strong>training set</strong> and a<strong>development set</strong>, with the first<strong>1000 samples</strong> reserved for development and the rest for training. Labels (digits 0-9) were stored separately, and data was shuffled before training to ensure randomness.</p></li><li><p>The neural network consists of an<strong>input layer (784 neurons)</strong>, a<strong>hidden layer (128 neurons, ReLU activation)</strong>, and an<strong>output layer (10 neurons, softmax activation)</strong>. Model parameters (weights and biases) were initialized randomly and updated using<strong>gradient descent</strong> over<strong>500 iterations</strong> with a learning rate of<strong>0.1</strong>. Training involved<strong>forward propagation</strong> to compute activations and<strong>backpropagation</strong> to update parameters. Accuracy was printed every<strong>10 iterations</strong>. To make the trained model compatible with<strong>Verilog</strong>, weights and biases were<strong>scaled by 10,000</strong> and saved as<strong>integer values</strong> in text files (<code>W1.txt</code>,<code>b1.txt</code>, etc.), preventing<strong>floating-point multiplication</strong> in hardware. These parameters were later reloaded for predictions on new images, verifying model accuracy on the<strong>development set</strong> before deployment in Verilog for real-time digit classification.</p></li><li><p>The model, trained on<strong>sample_data/mnist_train_small.csv</strong>, achieved over<strong>90% accuracy</strong>. It generates<code>W1</code>,<code>W2</code>,<code>b1</code>, and<code>b2</code> text files containing shape information. The trained parameters are used in Verilog to predict digits from an input image stored in<code>input_vector.txt</code>, which consists of<strong>784 space-separated integers</strong>. The predicted output is displayed in the terminal using<code>$display</code>. The original CSV file was converted into a space-separated text format where each line contains a digit followed by<strong>784 pixel values (785 total)</strong>. During prediction, the first value (label) is removed to test if the model correctly classifies the input image.</p></li><li><p>The<strong>Verilog module</strong> implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It comprises an<strong>input layer (784 neurons), hidden layer (128 neurons), and output layer (10 neurons)</strong>. The module reads<strong>pre-trained weights and biases</strong> from text files (<code>W1.txt</code>,<code>b1.txt</code>,<code>W2.txt</code>,<code>b2.txt</code>) along with an<strong>input vector</strong> from<code>input_vector.txt</code>. Input values are normalized by dividing by<strong>255.0</strong>, while weights and biases are scaled using a<strong>factor of 10,000</strong>. The hidden layer performs a fully connected transformation (<code>W1 * input + b1</code>) followed by<strong>ReLU activation</strong>. The output layer computes another weighted sum (<code>W2 * hidden + b2</code>) but does not apply softmax; instead, the predicted digit is determined by selecting the index of the highest output value.</p></li><li><p>The file reading process ensures proper loading of weights, biases, and input values before computation begins. Forward propagation occurs sequentially, with an initial delay for data loading. After computing activations in both layers, the module iterates through the output layer to identify the highest value, representing the predicted class. The classification result is then displayed. This hardware implementation streamlines neural network inference by<strong>eliminating complex activation functions</strong> like softmax while preserving classification accuracy through maximum output activation.</p></li><li><p>In newer versions of the code, the text files are converted into<strong>synthesizable memory blocks</strong> using Python scripts. These scripts store<strong>weights and biases</strong> in register modules, which are finally instantiated in the<strong>top-level module</strong>. The image data is also handled in a similar way.</p></li><li><p>Only the<code>$display</code> statement,<code>$finish</code>, and the<code>real</code> datatype in the final top-level module are non-synthesizable constructs. These can be eliminated by directing the predicted output to a seven-segment display using case statements [Moved these constructs to the testbench in later versions for a cleaner top module; currently working with<code>Q24.8</code> as a replacement for the real datatype].</p></li><li><p>I am currently working on replacing the<strong>training process</strong> with a Verilog-based implementation, aiming for a fully synthesizable neural network.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>This approach can pave a new way for POC, where text files are converted into register modules using Python scripts to automate the process. A top-level module can then connect all the generated modules, and the testbench can include $fopen, etc., to write the output text files. The testbench instantiates the top-level module, ensuring that all files are synthesizable.</p></blockquote><style>

a comprehensive explanation of the mathematical foundations behind each operation.</p><hr><h3 id="proof-of-concept-proposal-fpga-implementation-of-improve"><strong>Proof of Concept Proposal: FPGA Implementation of ImProVe</strong></h3><p>The goal of this proof of concept is to transition<strong>ImProVe</strong> from a Verilog-based image processing simulation to a fully FPGA-compatible implementation. The current approach, while functional, relies heavily on software-based file I/O, lacks real-time processing capabilities, and does not take advantage of hardware acceleration. This proposal outlines a new FPGA-based workflow that optimizes performance, enables parallel processing, and integrates efficient mathematical computation techniques like<strong>CORDIC for trigonometric and square root calculations</strong>.</p><h4 id="current-workflow-and-its-limitations"><strong>Current Workflow and Its Limitations</strong></h4><p>The existing implementation is purely<strong>simulation-based</strong>, using<strong>Icarus Verilog</strong> without testbenches. Images are pre-processed using<strong>Python (NumPy)</strong>, converted into<strong>.hex or .txt</strong> files, and then read into Verilog through file I/O functions. After processing, the results are stored in a corresponding output file, converted back into an image, and visually verified or cross-checked with a reference Python implementation.</p><p>While this approach enables functional validation, it suffers from several limitations:</p><ul><li><strong>File I/O is slow</strong> and does not reflect real-world FPGA-based image processing.</li><li><strong>No hardware optimizations</strong>, making it unsuitable for real-time applications.</li><li><strong>No pipelining or parallelism</strong>, leading to inefficient processing for large images.</li><li><strong>Mathematical operations</strong> (like square root and trigonometric functions) rely on direct computation rather than optimized hardware-friendly methods.</li></ul><h4 id="proposed-fpga-based-workflow"><strong>Proposed FPGA-Based Workflow</strong></h4><p>The<strong>FPGA implementation</strong> will be designed to replace file-based image processing with a<strong>high-speed AXI-based pipeline</strong> that processes images in real time. Key improvements include:</p><h5 id="cordic-for-mathematical-computation"><strong>CORDIC for Mathematical Computation</strong></h5><p>Operations like<strong>image rotation, edge detection, and geometric transformations</strong> require trigonometric functions (sin, cos) and square root calculations. Instead of using costly multipliers or look-up tables, these will be implemented using<strong>CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer)</strong>, which efficiently computes trigonometric functions, logarithms, and square roots in hardware without requiring floating-point arithmetic.</p><h5 id="memory-optimization-ddr-for-image-storage-bram-for-intermediate-buffers"><strong>Memory Optimization: DDR for Image Storage, BRAM for Intermediate Buffers</strong></h5><ul><li><strong>DDR (Dynamic RAM)</strong> will be used to store the original image and final processed output. This allows handling large images without running into FPGA memory constraints.</li><li><strong>BRAM (Block RAM)</strong> will serve as an intermediate buffer, storing smaller<strong>overlapping regions</strong> of the image during processing.</li><li><strong>AXI4 (Advanced eXtensible Interface)</strong> will manage data transfer between<strong>DDR and the processing modules</strong>, ensuring efficient memory access without bottlenecks.</li></ul><h5 id="axi-stream-for-processing-pipelines"><strong>AXI-Stream for Processing Pipelines</strong></h5><p>Rather than processing an image sequentially,<strong>AXI-Stream will enable a pipeline approach</strong>, where multiple processing stages operate in parallel. This allows continuous data flow, reducing latency and improving throughput.</p><h5 id="parallel-processing-using-image-splitting"><strong>Parallel Processing Using Image Splitting</strong></h5><p>For<strong>operations that do not involve geometric transformations</strong>, the image will be<strong>split into overlapping regions</strong> with necessary padding to avoid edge artifacts. These smaller blocks will be processed<strong>simultaneously</strong> and later recombined. This significantly speeds up computation while ensuring accuracy. For<strong>geometric transformations</strong>, special handling will be required to correctly map pixel positions.</p><h5 id="axi-dma-for-efficient-data-transfer"><strong>AXI DMA for Efficient Data Transfer</strong></h5><p>To avoid CPU intervention in moving image data,<strong>AXI DMA (Direct Memory Access)</strong> will be used to transfer pixel data<strong>directly between DDR and processing units</strong>, allowing continuous streaming of images into the pipeline without stalling.</p><h5 id="vgawireless-display-output-optional-enhancement"><strong>VGA/Wireless Display Output (Optional Enhancement)</strong></h5><p>If real-time visualization of processed images is needed, a<strong>VGA output or a wireless display interface (such as HDMI over Wi-Fi or LVDS panels)</strong> can be integrated. This eliminates the need for software-based file conversions and external host reconstruction, allowing direct, real-time monitoring of image processing results. While not mandatory, this enhancement can significantly improve debugging efficiency and system usability.</p><h5 id="testbenches-for-validation"><strong>Testbenches for Validation</strong></h5><p>To ensure<strong>mathematical accuracy</strong>, the new FPGA implementation will include<strong>systematic testbenches</strong> that validate outputs<strong>pixel-by-pixel</strong> against a Python reference. Unlike the current workflow, which relies on visual verification, this will ensure exact mathematical equivalence.</p><h4 id="expected-outcomes"><strong>Expected Outcomes</strong></h4><p>By implementing this optimized FPGA-based workflow,<strong>ImProVe</strong> will transition from a<strong>simulated Verilog project to a real-time, hardware-accelerated image processing system</strong>. The use of<strong>CORDIC, AXI-based memory architecture, parallel processing, pipelining, and real-time display output</strong> will significantly enhance performance, making the system viable for embedded vision applications in robotics, medical imaging, and autonomous systems.</p><p>I&rsquo;m working on the POC in parallel, and as of now, I have implemented square root using CORDIC, though it still requires some fine-tuning. This is just a proposal and may evolve further based on implementation challenges and optimizations needed along the way. The PoC will serve as a proof of concept for all the modules, ensuring they can be adapted for FPGA implementation. By the end, I aim to demonstrate at least one module as synthesizable and successfully implement it on an FPGA board.</p>

The role of the solver is crucial, as it computes the solution when a scrambled cube is presented.</p><p>We designed the system to fetch cube states directly from the user interface, where users can scramble or manipulate the cube. Upon clicking the &ldquo;Solve&rdquo; button, the Kociemba algorithm works under the hood to generate an optimal solution, which is then passed to the Unity engine. The Unity environment simulates this solution visually, step by step, allowing users to see the cube&rsquo;s transformation in real-time.</p><p>The<strong>Blender solution demo</strong> featured here is purely a visual mockup, simulating how the cube might appear when following a solved sequence. It serves as a demonstration for visual feedback but has no direct involvement in the solving process or algorithm implementation. This is an intermediate step showcasing the solution process and will be further integrated into Unity for enhanced user interaction.</p><h2 id="kociembas-algorithm-for-solving-a-rubiks-cube"><strong>Kociemba’s Algorithm for Solving a Rubik’s Cube</strong></h2><p>Kociemba’s Algorithm is a two-phase algorithm used to efficiently solve a 3×3 Rubik’s Cube in a minimal number of moves. It is an advanced method that improves upon simpler approaches, such as layer-by-layer (LBL) solving, by reducing the number of moves required to solve the cube.</p><p>Kociemba’s Algorithm is often used in optimal cube solvers, and it serves as the basis for algorithms like Herbert Kociemba’s Cube Explorer and the well-known<strong>Two-Phase Algorithm</strong>.</p><hr><h4 id="overview-of-the-algorithm"><strong>Overview of the Algorithm</strong></h4><p>The algorithm consists of two main phases:</p><ol><li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Reducing the cube to a subset of solvable states known as the<strong>&ldquo;G1 group&rdquo;</strong>.</li><li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Solving the cube optimally from this subset.</li></ol><p>By breaking the problem into these two phases, Kociemba’s Algorithm achieves solutions that typically require around 20 moves (or fewer), which is significantly shorter than beginner methods.</p><hr><h4 id="mathematical-background"><strong>Mathematical Background</strong></h4><p>The algorithm relies on<strong>group theory</strong>, particularly the concept of<strong>cosets</strong> and<strong>group reductions</strong>. In simple terms, it works by reducing the number of legal states the cube can be in while maintaining solvability.</p><p>The Rubik’s Cube has a<strong>state space</strong> of<strong>43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (43 quintillion) possible arrangements</strong>. Finding an optimal solution in this space is extremely complex, but by using the concept of<strong>group reduction</strong>, the problem is split into two more manageable parts.</p><hr><h4 id="phase-1-reduction-to-g1-group"><strong>PHASE 1: Reduction to G1 Group</strong></h4><p>In this phase, the cube is transformed into a<strong>restricted subset</strong> of states where:</p><ul><li>All edge orientations are correct (edges are in the correct flipped orientation).</li><li>All corner orientations are correct.</li><li>The positioning of the U/D (Up/Down) face edges falls into a specific allowed pattern.</li></ul><p>This phase<strong>does not solve</strong> the cube completely but simplifies it to a structured form that is easier to solve in the second phase.</p><h6 id="mathematical-properties-of-g1-group"><strong>Mathematical Properties of G1 Group</strong></h6><p>The group G1 is a subset of all possible cube states that satisfies the following conditions:</p><ol><li><strong>Edge Orientation is Solved</strong>: Each edge must be in its correct orientation.</li><li><strong>Corner Orientation is Solved</strong>: Each corner must be in its correct orientation.</li><li><strong>UD-Slice Edges Must Stay in the UD-Slice</strong>: The four edges belonging to the U (Up) and D (Down) face centers must remain within that slice.</li></ol><p>The key insight is that reducing the cube to this state significantly reduces the number of possible positions, making the final solving phase much easier.</p><h6 id="how-this-phase-works"><strong>How This Phase Works</strong></h6><ul><li>Kociemba’s algorithm uses a<strong>pruning table</strong> that precomputes the minimum number of moves required to reach the G1 state from any given configuration.</li><li>Using<strong>bidirectional search</strong>, the algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path to reach G1.</li><li>Typically, this phase takes<strong>at most 12 moves</strong>.</li></ul><hr><h4 id="phase-2-solving-the-cube-from-g1"><strong>PHASE 2: Solving the Cube from G1</strong></h4><p>Once the cube is in the<strong>G1 subset</strong>, the next step is to solve it completely while maintaining the constraints of G1.</p><h6 id="mathematical-properties-of-phase-2"><strong>Mathematical Properties of Phase 2</strong></h6><p>In this phase, we solve the cube while ensuring:</p><ol><li><strong>The E-Slice (Middle Layer Edges) is Correct</strong>: The four middle layer edges must be correctly positioned.</li><li><strong>Corner Permutation is Correct</strong>: The corners must be arranged correctly.</li><li><strong>Edge Permutation is Correct</strong>: All edges must be positioned correctly.</li></ol><p>At this point, the cube is already simplified, so a<strong>brute-force or optimized search</strong> (using a<strong>pruning table</strong>) is performed to find the shortest solution sequence.</p><ul><li>This phase usually takes around<strong>10 moves</strong> in most cases.</li><li>Since the cube is already in a reduced state,<strong>only a limited number of moves are needed</strong> to reach the solved state.</li></ul><hr><h4 id="key-techniques-used-in-kociembas-algorithm"><strong>Key Techniques Used in Kociemba’s Algorithm</strong></h4><h6 id="pruning-tables"><strong>Pruning Tables</strong></h6><ul><li>The algorithm precomputes<strong>lookup tables</strong> that store the shortest paths for solving different cube states.</li><li>These tables help the algorithm efficiently determine the best next move without unnecessary computations.</li></ul><h6 id="heuristic-search"><strong>Heuristic Search</strong></h6><ul><li>Kociemba’s Algorithm uses<em><em>A</em> search</em>* (or similar algorithms) to minimize the number of moves required to reach a solved state.</li><li>It evaluates different move sequences and picks the shortest one.</li></ul><h6 id="group-theory-based-reduction"><strong>Group Theory-Based Reduction</strong></h6><ul><li>The algorithm does not directly solve the cube but instead<strong>reduces it</strong> step by step to smaller solvable subsets.</li><li>By using<strong>cosets</strong> and<strong>subgroups</strong>, the problem is broken down into manageable parts.</li></ul><h6 id="move-pruning--bidirectional-search"><strong>Move Pruning &amp;

Our traffic light controller takes two inputs – CarA (which is high when there is a car just before the intersection on A Street – in either direction), and CarB (which is high when there is a car just before the intersection on B street). The controller needs to generate six outputs – RedA, YellowA, GreenA, RedB, YellowB, and GreenB – which drive the respective traffic lights for A Street and B Street. In the figure above, CarA will be high, since there is a car (the rectangle) on A Street, and CarB will be low, since there is no car on B Street. Also in the Figure RedA is high since A Street has a red light, and GreenB is high since B Street has a green light. All other outputs are low. We can think of the traffic light controller as a black box that takes two inputs (and a clock) and generates six outputs as shown below.</p><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="689" src="/images/projects/tlc/tlcblock_hu9325997977067735153.webp" alt="Original Image 1" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/tlc\/tlcblock_hu904393213427707066.png'"/><ol><li>When the light is green on A Street and a car is waiting on B Street, give A Street a yellow light for one clock cycle and then give A Street a red light and B Street a green light for at least two cycles.</li><li>When the light is green on A Street and there is no car on B Street, leave the light green on A Street.</li><li>When the is green on B Street (and we’ve finished the two cycles from step 1) and a car is waiting on A Street, give B Street a yellow light for one clock cycle and then give B Street a red light and A Street a green light for at least two cycles.</li><li>When the light is green on B Street and there is no car on A Street, leave the light green on B Street.</li><li>When you press the reset switch, after no more than six cycles, the light should be initially green on A Street and red on B Street and the controller should be ready for operation.</li></ol><h4 id="working">WORKING:</h4><p>We can translate these five rules into the following state diagram. For clarity, we omit the transitions that take all states to state AG2 (A Green 2nd cycle) when reset is true.</p><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="817" src="/images/projects/tlc/state-diagram_hu7133944902976557533.webp" alt="Original Image 1" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/tlc\/state-diagram_hu3948849623443658779.png'"/><p>Each circle in the state diagram represents a state. The name of the state is in the circle and the state of the six output lines (in the order listed above) is shown below that state. The transitions between the states are labeled with the signals that make these transitions occur. Most of the edges have no label which indicates that the transition always occurs (unless reset is asserted).
When our finite-state machine (FSM) is in state AG2, A Street has a green light and B Street has a red light. The transition from AG2 back to itself indicates that as long as there is no car on B Street we keep the A Street light green. The transition to AY (for A Yellow) indicates that if there is a car on B Street, we make the A Street light yellow on the next cycle. AY always transitions to BG1 (for B Green 1st cycle) where the A Street light becomes red and the B Street light becomes green. BG1 always transitions to BG2 where the FSM waits for a car on A Street before sequencing through BY and AG1 back to AG2.</p><p>From this state diagram we can write the following state table:</p><img

The Verilog module TLC defines a traffic light controller with inputs for clock (clk), reset (reset), and car presence on streets A and B (carA, carB). It generates outputs (lightsA, lightsB) to control the traffic lights and uses registers (ag2, ay, ag1, bg2, by, bg1) and wires (nag2, nay, nag1, nbg2, nby, nbg1) to manage internal state transitions and next state calculations (state).</p><p>Operation:
The module updates its internal state (ag2, ay, ag1, bg2, by, bg1) based on clock edges and input conditions, calculates next state bits (nag2, nay, nag1, nbg2, nby, nbg1) using state equations, and determines the output state of traffic lights (lightsA, lightsB) based on the current state and reset conditions using output equations.</p><h6 id="testbench-code-1">TESTBENCH CODE:</h6><p>Purpose:
This Verilog testbench (TLC_tb) is designed to simulate the behavior of the TLC module by providing input stimuli (clk, reset, carA, carB) and observing the corresponding outputs (lightsA, lightsB) and internal state (state). It helps validate the functionality and correctness of the TLC module under various test cases.</p><p>Operation:
The testbench initializes the inputs, generates a clock signal (clk), applies test cases with different input combinations, and displays the resulting outputs and state changes using $display. The testbench also connects the state wire to observe the internal state of the TLC module during simulation.</p><h4 id="ouput">OUPUT:</h4><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"

the controller is in reset mode (<code>1</code> = reset active,<code>0</code> = normal operation).</li><li><code>carA</code>: Indicates whether there is a car waiting on Street A (<code>1</code> = car present,<code>0</code> = no car).</li><li><code>carB</code>: Indicates whether there is a car waiting on Street B (<code>1</code> = car present,<code>0</code> = no car).</li><li><code>lightsA</code> and<code>lightsB</code>: 3-bit outputs indicating the light status for streets A and B, respectively:<ul><li><code>100</code>: Red</li><li><code>010</code>: Yellow</li><li><code>001</code>: Green</li></ul></li><li><code>state</code>: 6-bit internal state of the controller, where each bit corresponds to one of the states (<code>ag2</code>,<code>ay</code>,<code>ag1</code>,<code>bg2</code>,<code>by</code>,<code>bg1</code>).</li></ol><p><strong>Key Observations from the Output</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Reset Behavior</strong>:</p><ul><li>When<code>reset = 1</code>, the controller initializes to the default state (<code>AG2</code>), where Street A has a green light (<code>lightsA = 100</code>) and Street B has a red light (<code>lightsB = 100</code>).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>State Transitions</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial State</strong> (<code>AG2</code>): Street A has a green light, and Street B has a red light. The controller remains in this state as long as<code>carB = 0</code>.</li><li><strong>Transition to AY</strong>: When<code>carB = 1</code>, the controller transitions to<code>AY</code> (A Yellow), giving Street A a yellow light while preparing to switch to B Street.</li><li><strong>Transition to BG1/BG2</strong>: After<code>AY</code>, the controller transitions to<code>BG1</code> and<code>BG2</code>, giving Street B the green light and Street A the red light. The controller waits for at least two cycles on Street B (<code>BG1</code> and<code>BG2</code>) before checking for<code>carA</code>.</li><li><strong>Transition to BY</strong>: When<code>carA = 1</code>, the controller transitions to<code>BY</code> (B Yellow), switching from Street B back to Street A.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Input-Driven State Changes</strong>:</p><ul><li>The controller responds dynamically to<code>carA</code> and<code>carB</code>, switching states and light colors based on the presence of cars. For example:<ul><li><code>carA = 0, carB = 1</code>: Street B gets priority (transition from<code>AG2</code> →<code>AY</code> →<code>BG1</code>).</li><li><code>carA = 1, carB = 0</code>: Street A gets priority (transition from<code>BG2</code> →<code>BY</code> →<code>AG1</code>).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Output Consistency</strong>:</p><ul><li>The outputs (<code>lightsA</code> and<code>lightsB</code>) match the expected light status for each state in the state table:<ul><li><code>lightsA = 100</code> (Red for A) corresponds to<code>BG1</code>/<code>BG2</code> states.</li><li><code>lightsB = 001</code> (Green for B) corresponds to<code>BG1</code>/<code>BG2</code> states.</li><li><code>lightsA = 001</code> (Green for A) corresponds to<code>AG1</code>/<code>AG2</code> states.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Waveform Analysis</strong>:
The waveform visualizes the same transitions observed in the output table. Key points:</p><ul><li>The state bits change in accordance with the state transitions defined by the FSM.</li><li>The<code>lightsA</code> and<code>lightsB</code> signals follow the expected traffic light rules.</li><li><code>Reset</code> enforces the initial state (<code>AG2</code>), confirming the correctness of initialization.</li></ul>

The robot makes decisions based on sensor readings to move forward or turn as needed.</p><ul><li><strong>Proximity Sensors</strong>: The robot has eight proximity sensors (<code>ps0</code> to<code>ps7</code>) that detect walls and obstacles on all sides.</li><li><strong>Motors</strong>: Independent left and right wheel motors control the robot’s movement, enabling it to move forward, turn in place, or steer based on sensor inputs.</li></ul><h5 id="maze-exploration-strategy">Maze Exploration Strategy</h5><ul><li>The robot starts at a predefined position within the maze.</li><li>It explores the maze by following walls and avoiding obstacles until it reaches the target area.</li><li>The robot does not attempt to find the shortest path but instead explores all possible routes until it reaches the destination.</li></ul><h5 id="control-logic">Control Logic</h5><ul><li>The robot detects walls using its proximity sensors and adjusts its movement accordingly.</li><li>If there is a wall directly in front, it turns right.</li><li>If there is a wall on the left but none in front, it moves forward along the wall.</li><li>If no walls are detected, the robot makes a right turn.</li><li>The robot stops when it reaches the designated target region within the maze.</li></ul><hr><h4 id="installation-and-usage">Installation and Usage</h4><h5 id="requirements">Requirements</h5><ul><li><strong>Webots</strong>: Install the Webots robotics simulator from<a href="https://cyberbotics.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Python</strong>: Ensure Python is installed to run the robot controller.</li></ul><h5 id="steps-to-run">Steps to Run</h5><ol><li>Clone this repository to your local machine:<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git clone https://github.com/Mummanajagadeesh/wall-follower-robot-w.git</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cd wall-follower-robot-w</span></span></code></pre></div></li><li>Open Webots and load the<strong>wall_follower_robot.wbt</strong> world file in the simulation folder.</li><li>Run the simulation and observe the robot navigating through the maze.</li></ol><hr><h4 id="future-enhancements">Future Enhancements</h4><ul><li><strong>Optimized Pathfinding</strong>: Implementing algorithms like DFS, BFS, or A* to find the shortest path.</li><li><strong>PID Controller</strong>: Enhancing the robot’s movement with a PID controller for smoother turns and wall-following.</li><li><strong>Increased Maze Complexity</strong>: Introducing more challenging mazes with multiple solutions and dead-ends.</li></ul><hr>
