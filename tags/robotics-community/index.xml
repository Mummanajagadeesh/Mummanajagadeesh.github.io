      <title>Debugging a Robot In Simulation Before You Burn Wires</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware does not come with an undo button&lt;/strong&gt;. Once you power it on, mistakes—from reversed wiring to faulty code—can result in costly damage. Motors may overheat, printed circuit boards (PCBs) can be fried, and sensors may break. These issues turn exciting projects into frustrating repair sessions. The &lt;strong&gt;autonomous drone&lt;/strong&gt; shown above, designed for GNSS-denied environments in webots as part of the &lt;strong&gt;ISRO Robotics Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, is a perfect example—where careful planning, testing, and hardware safety were critical at every step&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My RosConIN&#39;24 (&#43;GNOME Asia Summit) Experience</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I missed ROSCon India due to exams and, honestly, had no idea what I was missing out on. This year, though, I made it, and it turned out to be more than I ever imagined. The two days I spent at ROSConIN&#39;24 were nothing short of transformative, and this blog itself is a result of the inspiration I drew from the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
