It was designed for on-board communication between integrated circuits, especially in systems with multiple low-speed peripherals controlled by a microcontroller.</description></item><item><title>Demystifying UART, SPI, and I2C: Communication Between Chips</title><link>https://mummanajagadeesh.github.io/blog/communication-between-chips/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 05:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mummanajagadeesh.github.io/blog/communication-between-chips/</guid><description>In both VLSI design and embedded systems, no chip operates in isolation. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a microcontroller interfacing with sensors, a processor communicating with memory modules, or multiple peripherals synchronizing data, inter-chip communication is fundamental to building reliable and scalable hardware systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
