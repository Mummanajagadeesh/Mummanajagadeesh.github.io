      <title>Why RISC-V Can Be a Game Changer?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an industry where silicon efficiency, design flexibility, and time-to-market are paramount, the limitations of proprietary processor architectures are becoming increasingly apparent. RISC-V, an open-source ISA, is reshaping the VLSI design landscape by enabling deeper hardware-software co-design, architectural customization at the RTL level, and tighter control over power, performance, and area (PPA)â€”without the constraints of licensing or closed specifications&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I missed ROSCon India due to exams and, honestly, had no idea what I was missing out on. This year, though, I made it, and it turned out to be more than I ever imagined. The two days I spent at ROSConIN&#39;24 were nothing short of transformative, and this blog itself is a result of the inspiration I drew from the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
