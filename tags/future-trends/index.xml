RISC-V, an open-source ISA, is reshaping the VLSI design landscape by enabling deeper hardware-software co-design, architectural customization at the RTL level, and tighter control over power, performance, and area (PPA)â€”without the constraints of licensing or closed specifications&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My RosConIN'24 (+GNOME Asia Summit) Experience</title><link>https://mummanajagadeesh.github.io/blog/my-rosconin24-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 05:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mummanajagadeesh.github.io/blog/my-rosconin24-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year, I missed ROSCon India due to exams and, honestly, had no idea what I was missing out on.
