Whether it’s a crossword, Sudoku, or that infuriating jigsaw piece that just won’t fit, puzzles have a unique way of grabbing our attention and holding it hostage. But have you ever wondered why solving puzzles feels so satisfying? Beyond the fun, puzzles sharpen your mind, boost your problem-solving skills, and, let’s be honest, give you bragging rights.</p><p>At their core, puzzles are challenges—a structured way to ask, “How do I figure this out?” And that question is more important than you might think. Life, in many ways, is a giant puzzle: decisions, strategies, unexpected twists. The better we get at solving little puzzles, the more equipped we are for the big ones.</p><h4 id="why-solve-puzzles">Why Solve Puzzles?</h4><p>Solving puzzles is like a gym session for your brain. They improve cognitive functions, boost memory, and enhance focus. But beyond brainpower, puzzles teach patience, perseverance, and the art of thinking outside the box—skills that are valuable in any field, from coding to cooking to simply navigating life.</p><p>And let’s not forget the dopamine rush! Every solved puzzle is a small victory, and our brains love rewarding us for it. Who doesn’t like a mental high five?</p><hr><h4 id="coding-the-ultimate-mental-puzzle">Coding: The Ultimate Mental Puzzle</h4><p>Now, let’s talk about coding—arguably one of the most satisfying puzzles you can tackle. Writing code is essentially solving a problem using logic, creativity, and a touch of wizardry. Each bug is a mini-puzzle, each feature a challenge to implement. And with coding puzzles, you’re not just solving; you’re building.</p><p>For those who’ve wrestled with algorithms, debugging, or optimizing code, you’ll agree: coding is a puzzle that never gets old. The beauty lies in its versatility. Problems evolve, solutions change, and the learning never stops.</p><hr><h4 id="two-hands-one-brain-the-magic-of-physical-puzzles">Two Hands, One Brain: The Magic of Physical Puzzles</h4><p>Now, let’s take this a step further: puzzles that involve not just your mind but your hands too. Think about the Rubik’s Cube, where both hemispheres of your brain are engaged. The left brain loves the logical sequences and patterns, while the right brain enjoys the spatial awareness and creativity. It’s like a full-brain workout.</p><p>Physical puzzles improve hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and your ability to multitask. Plus, there’s something incredibly satisfying about manipulating an object and watching it transform under your hands. For me, working with physical puzzles has always been a humbling experience—you can’t brute force them; they demand focus and finesse.</p><hr><h4 id="the-rubiks-cube-a-personal-journey">The Rubik’s Cube: A Personal Journey</h4><p>Ah, the Rubik’s Cube—a classic that’s equal parts intriguing and intimidating. My first encounter with it was… chaotic, to say the least. Scrambling it was easy, but solving it? Let’s just say it took me more than a few attempts (and some YouTube tutorials) to get it right.</p><p>But once I did, it was magical. Solving a Rubik’s Cube is a dance of logic and intuition. It teaches you to think in layers, anticipate moves, and stay calm under pressure. And honestly, it’s just plain cool to whip one out and solve it in front of friends.</p><hr><h4 id="puzzles-meet-tech-the-rubiks-cube-solver">Puzzles Meet Tech: The Rubik’s Cube Solver</h4><p>Now imagine combining the worlds of physical and digital puzzles. That’s exactly what we’ll be doing in the<strong>Rubik’s Cube Solver</strong> series. This project is a blend of hardware and software challenges—a perfect playground for anyone who loves puzzles.</p><p>The idea is to build a system that can solve a Rubik’s Cube autonomously. From understanding the cube’s mechanics to writing algorithms that optimize solutions, this project is as rewarding as it is complex. And here’s the best part: you’ll get to learn and build alongside me.</p><p><em>Note</em>: This project is still in its simulation phase. There are optimizations to be made, and the hardware implementation is yet to be completed. But that’s the beauty of this series—we’ll question every step, learn from every mistake, and inch closer to the solution together.</p><hr><h4 id="introducing-the-pid-series">Introducing the PID Series</h4><p>The Rubik’s Cube Solver is just the beginning. The<strong>PID: Project IN Detail</strong> series is a deep dive into my projects, where I share insights, challenges, and breakthroughs. There’s a lot more to come, and I’m thrilled to have you along for the ride.</p><p>In the next few posts, we’ll start with the basics of solving a Rubik’s Cube—the foundational techniques that will help you tackle the puzzle manually. From there, we’ll explore how computers can do it better, faster, and with optimizations we can only dream of.</p><hr><h4 id="why-wait-lets-get-started">Why Wait? Let’s Get Started!</h4><p>Puzzles are more than a pastime; they’re a way of thinking, learning, and growing. Whether you’re a coding enthusiast, a Rubik’s Cube aficionado, or just someone who loves a good challenge, this series has something for you.</p><p>So grab a cube, roll up your sleeves, and let’s dive into the fascinating world of puzzles—one twist at a time.</p>

Plus, I figured committing to a weekly blog post (every<strong><em>Friday</em></strong>, to keep myself accountable) might force me to stay consistent.</p><blockquote><p><strong>My motto?</strong> &ldquo;Knowledge grows best when shared.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><hr><h5 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h5><p>I’m currently a sophomore at<strong>NIT Calicut</strong>, studying<strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong>, with a minor in<strong>Robotics and Automation</strong>.</p><p>If I had to describe myself, I’d say I’m someone who loves building things, breaking things (not always on purpose!), and figuring out how stuff works. My favorite projects are the ones where software meets hardware—it’s where the real magic happens.</p><p>Oh, and quick confession: I’m<em>that guy</em> who always has a million unfinished projects because I keep jumping to the next shiny idea. Maybe this blog will help me finish more of them. Fingers crossed.</p><p>And yeah, like every robotics enthusiast, I’ve had my fair share of sparks and fried circuits along the way.

SPI. It operates using just two wires, like asynchronous serial, yet
supports communication with up to 1,008 peripheral devices. Unlike SPI,
I2C accommodates multi-controller systems, allowing more than one
controller to communicate with all peripheral devices on the bus
(although the controllers must take turns using the bus lines).</p><p>I2C data rates fall between those of asynchronous serial and SPI, with
most devices communicating at 100 kHz or 400 kHz. While there is some
overhead&mdash;requiring one additional acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) bit for
every 8 bits of data transmitted&mdash;I2C remains efficient. Although
implementing I2C requires more complex hardware than SPI, it is still
simpler than asynchronous serial and can be easily realized in software.</p><figure id="fig:i2c_block_diagram"><span class="image placeholder" data-original-image-src="i2c_block_diagram.png" data-original-image-title="" width="80%"/><figcaption>Block Diagram of an I2C System</figcaption></figure><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="600" src="/images/projects/i2cv/i2c_block_diagram_hu9724975040744162600.webp" alt="Block Diagram of an I2C System" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/i2cv\/i2c_block_diagram_hu8969938300534542992.png'"/><script>

devices on the bus. These two lines facilitate<strong>bidirectional,
half-duplex communication</strong>. I2C supports multiple controllers and
multiple target devices, making it a flexible choice for various
applications. It is essential to use<strong>pull-up resistors</strong> on both of
these lines to ensure proper operation. Fig<a href="#fig:i2c_implementation">2.4</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:i2c_implementation&rdquo;} shows a typical implementation of
the I2C physical layer.</p><figure id="fig:i2c_implementation"><span class="image placeholder" data-original-image-src="i2c_physical_layer.png" data-original-image-title="" width="80%"/><figcaption>Typical I2C Implementation</figcaption></figure><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="377" src="/images/projects/i2cv/i2c_physical_layer_hu5001890849971727351.webp" alt="Typical I2C Implementation" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/i2cv\/i2c_physical_layer_hu5413651912767855860.png'"/><p>One of the main reasons that I2C is a widely adopted protocol is due to
its requirement of only<strong>two lines</strong> for communication. The first line,<strong>SCL</strong>, is the serial clock line, primarily controlled by the
controller device. SCL is responsible for synchronously clocking data in
or out of the target device. The second line,<strong>SDA</strong>, is the serial
data line, used to transmit data to or from the target devices. For
instance, a controller device can send configuration data and output
codes to a target<strong>digital-to-analog converter (DAC)</strong>, or a target<strong>analog-to-digital converter (ADC)</strong> can send conversion data back to
the controller device.</p><p>I2C operates as a<strong>half-duplex communication</strong> protocol, meaning that
only one controller or target device can send data on the bus at any
given time. In contrast, the<strong>Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)</strong> is a<strong>full-duplex protocol</strong> that allows data to be sent and received
simultaneously, requiring four lines for communication: two data lines
for sending and receiving data, along with a serial clock and a unique
SPI chip select line to select the device for communication.</p><p>An I2C controller device initiates and terminates communication, which
eliminates potential issues related to<strong>bus contention</strong>. Communication
with a target device is established through a<strong>unique address</strong> on the
bus, allowing multiple controllers and multiple target devices to
coexist on the I2C bus.</p><p>The SDA and SCL lines have an<strong>open-drain connection</strong> to all devices
on the bus, necessitating a pull-up resistor connected to a common
voltage supply.</p><h5 id="open-drain-connection">Open-Drain Connection</h5><p>The<strong>open-drain connections</strong> are employed on both the SDA and SCL
lines and are linked to an NMOS transistor. This open-drain
configuration manages the I2C communication line by either pulling the
line low or allowing it to rise to a high state. The term "open-drain"
refers to the NMOS bus connection when the NMOS is turned<strong>OFF</strong>.
Figure<a href="#fig:open_drain_connection">2.5</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:open_drain_connection&rdquo;} illustrates the open-drain
connection when the NMOS is turned<strong>ON</strong>.</p><figure id="fig:open_drain_connection"><span class="image placeholder" data-original-image-src="open_drain_connection.png" data-original-image-title="" width="80%"/><figcaption>Open-Drain Connection Pulls Line Low When NMOS is Turned

transistor is either switched<strong>ON</strong> or<strong>OFF</strong>. When the NMOS is<strong>ON</strong>, it allows current to flow through the resistor to ground,
effectively pulling the open-drain line low. This transition from high
to low is typically rapid, as the NMOS quickly discharges any
capacitance on the SDA or SCL lines.</p><p>When the NMOS turns<strong>OFF</strong>, the device ceases to pull current, and the
pull-up resistor subsequently raises the SDA or SCL line back to<strong>VDD</strong>. Figure<a href="#fig:open_drain_off">2.6</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:open_drain_off&rdquo;} shows the open-drain line when the NMOS
is turned<strong>OFF</strong>, illustrating how the pull-up resistor brings the line
high.</p><figure id="fig:open_drain_off"><span class="image placeholder" data-original-image-src="open_drain_off.png" data-original-image-title="" width="80%"/><figcaption>Open-Drain Line with NMOS Turned Off</figcaption></figure><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="469" src="/images/projects/i2cv/open_drain_off_hu4560108909222930383.webp" alt="Open-Drain Line with NMOS Turned Off" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/i2cv\/open_drain_off_hu5878766402834574374.png'"/><p>The transition of the open-drain line to a high state is slower because
the line is pulled up against the bus capacitance, rather than being
actively driven high.</p><h4 id="i2c-protocol">I2C Protocol</h4><p>Communication over<strong>I2C</strong> requires a specific signaling protocol to
ensure that devices on the bus recognize valid I2C transmissions. While
this process is more intricate than<strong>UART</strong> or<strong>SPI</strong>, most
I2C-compatible devices handle the finer protocol details internally,
allowing developers to focus primarily on data exchange.</p><p><strong>SDA and SCL Lines:</strong> The I2C bus operates with two main lines:<strong>SDA</strong>
(Serial Data Line) and<strong>SCL</strong> (Serial Clock Line). Data is transmitted
over the<strong>SDA</strong> line in sync with clock pulses on the<strong>SCL</strong> line.
Generally, data is placed on<strong>SDA</strong> when<strong>SCL</strong> is low, and devices
sample this data when<strong>SCL</strong> goes high. If needed, multiple internal<strong>registers</strong> may control data handling, especially in complex devices.</p><p><strong>Protocol Components:</strong></p><p>1.<strong>Start Condition:</strong> To initiate communication, the controller sets<strong>SCL</strong> high and then pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low. This signals all peripheral
devices on the bus that a transmission is starting. In cases where
multiple controllers attempt to start communication simultaneously, the
first device to pull<strong>SDA</strong> low gains control. If necessary, the
controller can issue repeated start conditions to maintain bus control
without releasing it.</p><p>2.<strong>Address Frame:</strong> Every I2C transmission begins with an<strong>address
frame</strong> to specify the target peripheral. This frame consists of a 7-bit
address, sent<strong>MSB</strong> (most significant bit) first, followed by a<strong>R/W
bit</strong> indicating the operation type (read or write).</p><p>After this, the 9th bit, known as the<strong>ACK/NACK bit</strong>, is used by the
receiving device to confirm reception. If the device pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low
before the 9th clock pulse (<strong>ACK</strong>), communication continues. If not
(<strong>NACK</strong>), it indicates either unrecognized data or an issue in
reception, prompting the controller to decide the next steps.</p><p>3.<strong>Data Frames:</strong> Following the address frame, one or more<strong>data
frames</strong> are sent over the<strong>SDA</strong> line. Each data frame is 8 bits, and
data is transferred from the controller to the peripheral or vice versa,
based on the<strong>R/W bit</strong> in the address frame.</p><p>Many peripheral devices have auto-incrementing<strong>internal registers</strong>,
enabling data to continue from consecutive registers without the need to
re-specify the register address.</p><p>4.<strong>Stop Condition:</strong> The controller ends communication by generating
a<strong>stop condition</strong>. This is done by transitioning<strong>SDA</strong> from low to
high after a high-to-low transition on<strong>SCL</strong>, with<strong>SCL</strong> held high
during the stop sequence. To avoid false stop conditions, the value on<strong>SDA</strong> should not change while<strong>SCL</strong> is high during regular data
transmission.</p><p>The<strong>I2C protocol</strong> divides communication into structured<strong>frames</strong>.
Each communication sequence begins with a<strong>START</strong> condition, initiated
by the controller, followed by an<strong>address frame</strong> and then one or more<strong>data frames</strong>. Every frame also includes an acknowledgment (ACK) bit,
signaling that the frame has been received successfully by the intended
device.<strong>Figure 3-3</strong> illustrates the structure of two I2C
communication frames, showing both address and data frames in detail.</p><figure id="fig:i2c_frames"><span class="image placeholder" data-original-image-src="i2c_frames.png" data-original-image-title="" width="80%"/><figcaption>I2C Address and Data Frames</figcaption></figure><img title="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="img  " width="1000" height="214" src="/images/projects/i2cv/i2c_frames_hu8079952379911720152.webp" alt="I2C Address and Data Frames" onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/i2cv\/i2c_frames_hu17776359726810003991.png'"/><p>In an I2C transaction, the controller first sends a<strong>START condition</strong>
by pulling the<strong>SDA</strong> line low, followed by the<strong>SCL</strong> line. This
sequence asserts control over the bus, preventing other devices from
interfering. Each target device on the I2C bus has a unique<strong>7-bit
address</strong>, allowing the controller to specify which target device it
intends to communicate with.</p><p>Once the address is set on<strong>SDA</strong> while<strong>SCL</strong> acts as the clock, the<strong>8th bit</strong> (R/W bit) indicates the intended operation type:<strong>read
(1)</strong> or<strong>write (0)</strong>. This initial address and R/W bit are followed by
an<strong>ACK bit</strong>, sent by the target device to confirm receipt. If the
target device receives the address successfully, it pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low
during the next<strong>SCL</strong> pulse, signaling an ACK. If no device
acknowledges, the line remains high, signaling a<strong>NACK</strong>.</p><p>After the address frame, one or more<strong>data frames</strong> follow. Each data
frame contains 8 bits of data, which are acknowledged (ACK) in the 9th
bit. If the data frame is a<strong>write</strong> operation, the target device pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low to confirm data receipt. For<strong>read</strong> operations, the
controller pulls<strong>SDA</strong> low to acknowledge receipt of the data. The
presence or absence of the ACK is essential for troubleshooting, as a
missing ACK may indicate an addressing error or transmission failure.</p><p>Finally, the communication ends with a<strong>STOP condition</strong>, where the
controller releases<strong>SCL</strong> first, followed by<strong>SDA</strong>. This action
releases the I2C bus for other devices to use, completing the
communication cycle.</p><p>This structured protocol allows for the transmission of multiple bytes
within one communication sequence. In cases where a target device has
multiple internal<strong>registers</strong>, a write operation can specify the
register to read or write data to, enhancing flexibility and enabling
complex data transactions.</p><h1 id="module-specifications">Module Specifications</h1><h4 id="master-module">MASTER MODULE</h4><h5 id="c0d3">C0d3</h5><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"

code is a Verilog implementation of an I2C Master Module.
This module enables communication with I2C-compatible devices through
the I2C protocol by implementing the necessary operations to generate
I2C signals and manage data transfer. Let&rsquo;s break down each section of
the code:</p><h6 id="module-declaration">Module Declaration</h6><p>The code begins with the module declaration:</p><blockquote><pre><code>module i2c_master(
input wire clk, // System clock
input wire rst, // Synchronous reset
input wire [6:0] addr, // 7-bit I2C address
input wire [7:0] data_in, // Data to be transmitted
input wire enable, // Enable signal to start I2C transaction
input wire rw, // Read/Write control (0 = Write, 1 = Read)
output reg [7:0] data_out, // Data received from I2C
output wire ready, // Ready signal when module is idle
inout i2c_sda, // I2C data line (SDA)
inout wire i2c_scl // I2C clock line (SCL)
);</code></pre></blockquote><p>This module contains inputs for the system clock (<code>clk</code>), reset (<code>rst</code>),
I2C address (<code>addr</code>), data to be sent (<code>data_in</code>), an enable signal
(<code>enable</code>), and a Read/Write control (<code>rw</code>). It also provides outputs
for data received (<code>data_out</code>), a ready status signal (<code>ready</code>), and
bidirectional I2C lines,<code>i2c_sda</code> and<code>i2c_scl</code>.</p><h6 id="state-machine-definition">State Machine Definition</h6><p>The code defines several states representing stages in the I2C
transaction:</p><blockquote><pre><code>localparam IDLE = 0;
localparam START = 1;
localparam ADDRESS = 2;
localparam READ_ACK = 3;
localparam WRITE_DATA = 4;
localparam WRITE_ACK = 5;
localparam READ_DATA = 6;
localparam READ_ACK2 = 7;
localparam STOP = 8;</code></pre></blockquote><p>Each<code>localparam</code> corresponds to a state in the Finite State Machine
(FSM), controlling the I2C protocol flow, including start, address
transmission, acknowledgment (ACK) reception, data transfer, and stop
condition generation.</p><h6 id="clock-divider">Clock Divider</h6><p>To generate a slower clock for the I2C operations, a clock divider is
implemented:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(posedge clk) begin
if (counter2 == (DIVIDE_BY / 2) - 1) begin
i2c_clk &lt;= ~i2c_clk;
counter2 &lt;= 0;
end else counter2 &lt;= counter2 + 1;
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>This block toggles<code>i2c_clk</code> at a lower frequency than the system clock,<code>clk</code>, using a counter<code>counter2</code> with a division factor defined by<code>DIVIDE_BY</code>.</p><h6 id="sda-and-scl-control">SDA and SCL Control</h6><p>To control the<code>i2c_sda</code> and<code>i2c_scl</code> lines based on the module&rsquo;s
state:</p><blockquote><pre><code>assign ready = ((rst == 0) &amp;&amp; (state == IDLE)) ? 1 : 0;
assign i2c_scl = (i2c_scl_enable == 0) ? 1 : i2c_clk;
assign i2c_sda = (write_enable == 1) ? sda_out : 'bz;</code></pre></blockquote><ul><li><p><code>ready</code> is high when the reset is inactive and the state is<code>IDLE</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>i2c_scl</code> is either high (idle state) or follows the divided<code>i2c_clk</code> signal.</p></li><li><p><code>i2c_sda</code> outputs the value of<code>sda_out</code> when<code>write_enable</code> is
active. When<code>write_enable</code> is inactive,<code>i2c_sda</code> goes to
high-impedance (<code>’bz</code>) for reading data.</p></li></ul><h6 id="finite-state-machine-fsm">Finite State Machine (FSM)</h6><p>The FSM controls the I2C communication process, progressing through
states based on the I2C protocol requirements:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(posedge i2c_clk or posedge rst) begin
if (rst == 1) begin
state &lt;= IDLE;
end else begin
case (state)
IDLE: begin
if (enable) begin
state &lt;= START;
saved_addr &lt;= {addr, rw};
saved_data &lt;= data_in;
end
end
START: begin
counter &lt;= 7;
state &lt;= ADDRESS;
end
...
STOP: begin
state &lt;= IDLE;
end
endcase
end
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>Each state corresponds to an I2C operation:</p><ul><li><p><code>IDLE</code>: Waits for<code>enable</code> signal to initiate communication.</p></li><li><p><code>START</code>: Prepares a start condition by asserting<code>sda_out</code> low.</p></li><li><p><code>ADDRESS</code>: Sends the address and R/W bit.</p></li><li><p><code>READ_ACK</code> and<code>READ_ACK2</code>: Verifies acknowledgment (ACK) from the
slave.</p></li><li><p><code>WRITE_DATA</code> and<code>WRITE_ACK</code>: Transfers data to the slave and waits
for ACK.</p></li><li><p><code>READ_DATA</code>: Receives data from the slave.</p></li><li><p><code>STOP</code>: Generates a stop condition and returns to<code>IDLE</code>.</p></li></ul><h6 id="sda-output-logic">SDA Output Logic</h6><p>The logic for controlling the<code>i2c_sda</code> line, depending on the FSM
state, is implemented as follows:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(negedge i2c_clk or posedge rst) begin
if (rst == 1) begin
write_enable &lt;= 1;
sda_out &lt;= 1;
end else begin
case (state)
START: begin
write_enable &lt;= 1;
sda_out &lt;= 0;
end
ADDRESS: begin
sda_out &lt;= saved_addr[counter];
end
...
STOP: begin
write_enable &lt;= 1;
sda_out &lt;= 1;
end
endcase
end
end</code></pre></blockquote><ul><li><p>In the<code>START</code> state,<code>sda_out</code> goes low to generate a start
condition.</p></li><li><p>In the<code>ADDRESS</code> and<code>WRITE_DATA</code> states,<code>sda_out</code> sends the bits
of<code>saved_addr</code> or<code>saved_data</code>.</p></li><li><p>In<code>STOP</code>,<code>sda_out</code> goes high to signify the end of the
transmission.</p></li></ul><p>This Verilog module effectively implements an I2C Master communication
sequence by controlling the<code>i2c_sda</code> and<code>i2c_scl</code> lines according to
the I2C protocol.</p><h4 id="slave-module">SLAVE MODULE</h4><h5 id="c0d3-1">C0d3</h5><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"

id="explanation-1">Explanation</h5><p>The Verilog code presented is for an I2C Slave Module that implements
the core logic for an I2C slave device capable of receiving and
transmitting data over the I2C protocol. Let&rsquo;s break down the components
of the code and their functionality:</p><h6 id="module-declaration-1">Module Declaration</h6><p>The module begins with the declaration of inputs and outputs:</p><blockquote><pre><code>module i2c_slave(
input [6:0] addr_in, // Dynamic address input for I2C slave
inout sda, // I2C data line (SDA)
inout scl // I2C clock line (SCL)
);</code></pre></blockquote><p>The inputs include a 7-bit address (<code>addr_in</code>) for the slave device,
along with the bidirectional<code>sda</code> and<code>scl</code> lines for data and clock
signals respectively.</p><h6 id="state-machine-definition-1">State Machine Definition</h6><p>The I2C protocol relies on a finite state machine (FSM) to control the
data transfer sequence. The FSM is represented by five states:</p><blockquote><pre><code>localparam READ_ADDR = 0;
localparam SEND_ACK = 1;
localparam READ_DATA = 2;
localparam WRITE_DATA = 3;
localparam SEND_ACK2 = 4;</code></pre></blockquote><p>Each state corresponds to a particular phase of the I2C communication: -<code>READ_ADDR</code>: Reads the I2C address and R/W bit. -<code>SEND_ACK</code>: Sends
acknowledgment (ACK) if the address matches. -<code>READ_DATA</code>: Receives
data from the master. -<code>WRITE_DATA</code>: Sends data to the master. -<code>SEND_ACK2</code>: Sends a second ACK after data reception.</p><h6 id="internal-registers-and-signals">Internal Registers and Signals</h6><p>Several internal registers and signals are declared to support the
functionality of the I2C slave: -<code>addr</code> holds the slave address and R/W
bit. -<code>counter</code> is used to count bits during transmission. -<code>state</code>
holds the current FSM state. -<code>data_in</code> and<code>data_out</code> store the
incoming and outgoing data, respectively. -<code>sda_out</code> and<code>sda_in</code>
control the data line (SDA). -<code>start</code> flags the detection of the I2C
start condition. -<code>write_enable</code> controls whether the slave can drive
the SDA line.</p><h6 id="sda-line-control">SDA Line Control</h6><p>The assignment of the<code>sda</code> line is conditional on the<code>write_enable</code>
signal:</p><blockquote><pre><code>assign sda = (write_enable == 1) ? sda_out : 'bz;</code></pre></blockquote><p>This means that the slave drives the<code>sda</code> line when<code>write_enable</code> is
active, otherwise, the line is in high-impedance state (&lsquo;bz).</p><h6 id="start-and-stop-condition-detection">Start and Stop Condition Detection</h6><p>The start condition is detected when there is a falling edge on the<code>sda</code> line while the<code>scl</code> line is high, and the stop condition is
detected when there is a rising edge on the<code>sda</code> line while<code>scl</code> is
high. These conditions trigger transitions in the FSM.</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(negedge sda) begin
if ((start == 0) &amp;&amp; (scl == 1)) begin
start &lt;= 1; // Set start flag
counter &lt;= 7; // Initialize bit counter
end
end
always @(posedge sda) begin
if ((start == 1) &amp;&amp; (scl == 1)) begin
state &lt;= READ_ADDR; // Transition to READ_ADDR state
start &lt;= 0; // Reset start flag
write_enable &lt;= 0; // Disable write
end
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>These blocks capture the start and stop conditions and manage the FSM
transitions accordingly.</p><h6 id="fsm-logic-for-data-transfer">FSM Logic for Data Transfer</h6><p>The FSM operates on the rising edge of the<code>scl</code> signal, progressing
through various states based on the detected conditions:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(posedge scl) begin
if (start == 1) begin
case(state)
READ_ADDR: begin
addr[counter] &lt;= sda;
if(counter == 0) state &lt;= SEND_ACK;
else counter &lt;= counter - 1;
end
SEND_ACK: begin
if(addr[7:1] == addr_in) begin
counter &lt;= 7;
if(addr[0] == 0) begin
state &lt;= READ_DATA; // If write mode, move to READ_DATA
end else state &lt;= WRITE_DATA; // Else move to WRITE_DATA
end else state &lt;= READ_ADDR;
end
...
endcase
end
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>The state transitions depend on whether the address matches, the R/W
bit, and whether data is being read or written. The<code>SEND_ACK</code> state
sends an acknowledgment if the address is correct, while the<code>READ_DATA</code>
and<code>WRITE_DATA</code> states handle data reception and transmission
respectively.</p><h6 id="sda-output-logic-1">SDA Output Logic</h6><p>The logic for controlling the<code>sda</code> output during the FSM states is
defined in the following block:</p><blockquote><pre><code>always @(negedge scl) begin
case(state)
READ_ADDR: begin
write_enable &lt;= 0; // Disable writing during address read
end
SEND_ACK: begin
sda_out &lt;= (addr[7:1] == addr_in) ? 0 : 1; // Send ACK (0) or NACK (1)
write_enable &lt;= 1;
end
READ_DATA: begin
write_enable &lt;= 0; // Disable writing during data read
end
WRITE_DATA: begin
sda_out &lt;= data_out[counter]; // Output data bit by bit
write_enable &lt;= 1;
end
SEND_ACK2: begin
sda_out &lt;= 0; // Send ACK (0) after data reception
write_enable &lt;= 1;
end
endcase
end</code></pre></blockquote><p>Each state manipulates the<code>sda_out</code> signal to either send an
acknowledgment (ACK) or transmit the data bit by bit. The<code>SEND_ACK</code>
state checks the address match and sends either an ACK or NACK. The<code>WRITE_DATA</code> state sends the data, while the<code>SEND_ACK2</code> state sends an
ACK after data reception.</p><h6 id="summary">Summary</h6><p>This Verilog code implements a simple I2C Slave module that can handle
basic I2C communication. It includes start/stop condition detection,
address matching, data reception, and data transmission using an FSM.

This successful transmission and receipt of data verify correct read functionality with an address match.</p><h3 id="challenges-and-risk-analysis">Challenges and Risk Analysis</h3><h4 id="potential-issues-and-solutions">Potential Issues and Solutions</h4><p>In the development of the I2C communication project, I encountered several challenges, starting with the design of basic Verilog modules for both master and slave entities capable of fundamental read and write operations. After an initial review of the I2C protocol from various online resources and Verilog syntax, I designed a preliminary testbench module to simulate and validate the basic functionality.</p><p>As the project progressed, I introduced additional functionality, including ACK and NACK flags, to handle incorrect slave addresses and refined the finite state machine (FSM) logic for more reliable state transitions. To make the slave module independent of global configurations, I designed a top-level module that instantiated both the master and slave modules and added an extra layer of address validation.</p><p>For synchronization, I implemented clock stretching between address and data frames. This addition worked effectively during address transmission but revealed timing issues during data frame read operations. After extensive troubleshooting, I identified limitations in the initial approach and modified the design accordingly.</p><p>I also explored a multi-master, multi-slave configuration, assigning slave addresses in the format<code>10101XY</code> (with<code>XY</code> values as 00, 01, 10, and 11 for slaves 1 through 4) and a master select line in the testbench to choose the active master. Preloaded data in each slave was structured as<code>110011XY</code> to streamline read operations. However, unresolved synchronization issues in the multi-master setup led me to scale back to a single-master, single-slave model, excluding clock stretching and multiple nodes. The final design focuses on single-point communication, with code attempts for the multi-master setup included in the project appendix on GitHub.</p><h4 id="risk-management">Risk Management</h4><p>Several potential risks emerged during the design and integration phases:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Design Complexity</strong>: The complexity of the I2C protocol and multi-node configuration posed unforeseen design challenges. A modular testing approach mitigated these risks by allowing iterative refinements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Timing Issues</strong>: Timing mismatches, particularly in multi-master configurations, impacted protocol accuracy. While resolved in the single-master model, this remains an area for future improvement.</p></li><li><p><strong>FSM Complexity</strong>: Introducing ACK/NACK handling increased the complexity of the FSM, raising the potential for state transition errors. Comprehensive simulation and debugging minimized these risks.</p></li></ul><p>In this project, I implemented the clock stretching functionality and addressed timing issues in data frame read operations. Starting with basic I2C modules, I managed the synchronization aspect by incorporating clock stretching between address and data frames, a mechanism crucial for addressing timing issues in the protocol. Despite progress, some discrepancies remain in the data frame during read operations, which are planned for future enhancements.</p><p>Additionally, I expanded the basic modules by introducing acknowledgment (ACK) and negative acknowledgment (NACK) flags to handle erroneous addresses. I refined the FSM logic to improve state transitions, address handling, and protocol management complexities. While the initial goal was a multi-master configuration with selectable slave nodes, unresolved timing issues led to a focus on a single-master, single-slave model, effectively capturing the core aspects of I2C communication in the final implementation.</p><h3 id="future-work-and-improvements">Future Work and Improvements</h3><h4 id="suggested-enhancements">Suggested Enhancements</h4><p>Future enhancements to this project could include adding more registers
to each slave, allowing for more sophisticated data handling. Additional
registers would enable more extensive data storage and retrieval options
in each slave device, making the project closer to real-world I2C
applications.</p><h4 id="alternative-designs">Alternative Designs</h4><p>Exploring alternative FSM architectures could improve the efficiency and
stability of the I2C protocol, especially for multi-master
configurations. Further, advanced data synchronization techniques,
possibly through modified clock stretching or data frame timing
adjustments, could address the current timing issues. Replacing the
current point-to-point master-slave setup with a robust multi-node
configuration, if resolved, could significantly enhance the protocol&rsquo;s
scalability.</p><h3 id="appendices">Appendices</h3><h4 id="verilog-code-listings">Verilog Code Listings</h4><p>The complete Verilog code for the I2C Master module, including support

As usual, I didn’t have any notes and had to rely on a friend to send pictures of their notes. While scanning and rotating the images to create PDFs, an idea struck me: why not do this image rotation using Verilog?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>That’s how it all began! With the exam the next day and my head deep in Verilog, I started experimenting with image rotation. From there, the journey took off.</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;What if I tried implementing other basic geometric transformations like cropping, translation, and shearing?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>This curiosity pushed me further, leading me to explore edge detection techniques like Prewitt, Sobel, Kirsch Compass, Robinson Compass, and even advanced methods like Canny.</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;How about adding noise reduction and blurring methods like median, Gaussian, and box filters?&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>To be honest, I didn’t know how many of these techniques worked at first. I learned the math behind each process as I implemented it. As the project grew bigger, it became clear this was no longer just about rotating an image. So, I gave it a new name:<strong>ImProVe – Image Processing Using Verilog</strong>.</p><h4 id="aim"><strong>Aim</strong></h4><p>The goal of this project is simple yet ambitious:<br><em>&ldquo;Build a set of foundational image processing blocks that can be deployed on hardware for real-world applications.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Here’s what I’ve accomplished so far:</p><ul><li><strong>Label Detection</strong>:<br><em>&ldquo;Using Prewitt and Canny edge detectors, I implemented a process to detect label boundaries. By identifying sudden intensity changes between pixels, I created a bounding box in the red channel, which was later overlaid using Python.&rdquo;</em></li><li><strong>Document Scanner (In Progress)</strong>:<br><em>&ldquo;This builds on the label detection process but takes it further by identifying all four corners of a document. The goal is to map the detected quadrilateral to a rectangle using basic geometric transformations. I’m also planning to integrate OCR into this module.&rdquo;</em></li></ul><h6 id="the-challenge"><strong>THE Challenge</strong></h6><p><em>&ldquo;The project isn’t just about implementing these techniques—it’s about making them synthesizable for hardware. Currently, there are many simulation constructs that aren’t FPGA-friendly.

The role of the solver is crucial, as it computes the solution when a scrambled cube is presented.</p><p>We designed the system to fetch cube states directly from the user interface, where users can scramble or manipulate the cube. Upon clicking the &ldquo;Solve&rdquo; button, the Kociemba algorithm works under the hood to generate an optimal solution, which is then passed to the Unity engine. The Unity environment simulates this solution visually, step by step, allowing users to see the cube&rsquo;s transformation in real-time.</p><p>The<strong>Blender solution demo</strong> featured here is purely a visual mockup, simulating how the cube might appear when following a solved sequence. It serves as a demonstration for visual feedback but has no direct involvement in the solving process or algorithm implementation. This is an intermediate step showcasing the solution process and will be further integrated into Unity for enhanced user interaction.</p><h2 id="kociembas-algorithm-for-solving-a-rubiks-cube"><strong>Kociemba’s Algorithm for Solving a Rubik’s Cube</strong></h2><p>Kociemba’s Algorithm is a two-phase algorithm used to efficiently solve a 3×3 Rubik’s Cube in a minimal number of moves. It is an advanced method that improves upon simpler approaches, such as layer-by-layer (LBL) solving, by reducing the number of moves required to solve the cube.</p><p>Kociemba’s Algorithm is often used in optimal cube solvers, and it serves as the basis for algorithms like Herbert Kociemba’s Cube Explorer and the well-known<strong>Two-Phase Algorithm</strong>.</p><hr><h4 id="overview-of-the-algorithm"><strong>Overview of the Algorithm</strong></h4><p>The algorithm consists of two main phases:</p><ol><li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Reducing the cube to a subset of solvable states known as the<strong>&ldquo;G1 group&rdquo;</strong>.</li><li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Solving the cube optimally from this subset.</li></ol><p>By breaking the problem into these two phases, Kociemba’s Algorithm achieves solutions that typically require around 20 moves (or fewer), which is significantly shorter than beginner methods.</p><hr><h4 id="mathematical-background"><strong>Mathematical Background</strong></h4><p>The algorithm relies on<strong>group theory</strong>, particularly the concept of<strong>cosets</strong> and<strong>group reductions</strong>. In simple terms, it works by reducing the number of legal states the cube can be in while maintaining solvability.</p><p>The Rubik’s Cube has a<strong>state space</strong> of<strong>43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (43 quintillion) possible arrangements</strong>.

The name of the state is in the circle and the state of the six output lines (in the order listed above) is shown below that state. The transitions between the states are labeled with the signals that make these transitions occur. Most of the edges have no label which indicates that the transition always occurs (unless reset is asserted).
When our finite-state machine (FSM) is in state AG2, A Street has a green light and B Street has a red light. The transition from AG2 back to itself indicates that as long as there is no car on B Street we keep the A Street light green. The transition to AY (for A Yellow) indicates that if there is a car on B Street, we make the A Street light yellow on the next cycle. AY always transitions to BG1 (for B Green 1st cycle) where the A Street light becomes red and the B Street light becomes green. BG1 always transitions to BG2 where the FSM waits for a car on A Street before sequencing through BY and AG1 back to AG2.</p><p>From this state diagram we can write the following state table:</p><img

The Verilog module TLC defines a traffic light controller with inputs for clock (clk), reset (reset), and car presence on streets A and B (carA, carB). It generates outputs (lightsA, lightsB) to control the traffic lights and uses registers (ag2, ay, ag1, bg2, by, bg1) and wires (nag2, nay, nag1, nbg2, nby, nbg1) to manage internal state transitions and next state calculations (state).</p><p>Operation:
The module updates its internal state (ag2, ay, ag1, bg2, by, bg1) based on clock edges and input conditions, calculates next state bits (nag2, nay, nag1, nbg2, nby, nbg1) using state equations, and determines the output state of traffic lights (lightsA, lightsB) based on the current state and reset conditions using output equations.</p><h6 id="testbench-code-1">TESTBENCH CODE:</h6><p>Purpose:
This Verilog testbench (TLC_tb) is designed to simulate the behavior of the TLC module by providing input stimuli (clk, reset, carA, carB) and observing the corresponding outputs (lightsA, lightsB) and internal state (state). It helps validate the functionality and correctness of the TLC module under various test cases.</p><p>Operation:
The testbench initializes the inputs, generates a clock signal (clk), applies test cases with different input combinations, and displays the resulting outputs and state changes using $display. The testbench also connects the state wire to observe the internal state of the TLC module during simulation.</p><h4 id="ouput">OUPUT:</h4><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0"

onerror="this.onerror='null';this.src='\/images\/projects\/tlc\/waveform_hu2771881731006117160.png'"/><p><strong>Output Columns Explanation</strong>:</p><ol><li><code>reset</code>: Indicates whether the controller is in reset mode (<code>1</code> = reset active,<code>0</code> = normal operation).</li><li><code>carA</code>: Indicates whether there is a car waiting on Street A (<code>1</code> = car present,<code>0</code> = no car).</li><li><code>carB</code>: Indicates whether there is a car waiting on Street B (<code>1</code> = car present,<code>0</code> = no car).</li><li><code>lightsA</code> and<code>lightsB</code>: 3-bit outputs indicating the light status for streets A and B, respectively:<ul><li><code>100</code>: Red</li><li><code>010</code>: Yellow</li><li><code>001</code>: Green</li></ul></li><li><code>state</code>: 6-bit internal state of the controller, where each bit corresponds to one of the states (<code>ag2</code>,<code>ay</code>,<code>ag1</code>,<code>bg2</code>,<code>by</code>,<code>bg1</code>).</li></ol><p><strong>Key Observations from the Output</strong>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Reset Behavior</strong>:</p><ul><li>When<code>reset = 1</code>, the controller initializes to the default state (<code>AG2</code>), where Street A has a green light (<code>lightsA = 100</code>) and Street B has a red light (<code>lightsB = 100</code>).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>State Transitions</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial State</strong> (<code>AG2</code>): Street A has a green light, and Street B has a red light. The controller remains in this state as long as<code>carB = 0</code>.</li><li><strong>Transition to AY</strong>: When<code>carB = 1</code>, the controller transitions to<code>AY</code> (A Yellow), giving Street A a yellow light while preparing to switch to B Street.</li><li><strong>Transition to BG1/BG2</strong>: After<code>AY</code>, the controller transitions to<code>BG1</code> and<code>BG2</code>, giving Street B the green light and Street A the red light. The controller waits for at least two cycles on Street B (<code>BG1</code> and<code>BG2</code>) before checking for<code>carA</code>.</li><li><strong>Transition to BY</strong>: When<code>carA = 1</code>, the controller transitions to<code>BY</code> (B Yellow), switching from Street B back to Street A.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Input-Driven State Changes</strong>:</p><ul><li>The controller responds dynamically to<code>carA</code> and<code>carB</code>, switching states and light colors based on the presence of cars. For example:<ul><li><code>carA = 0, carB = 1</code>: Street B gets priority (transition from<code>AG2</code> →<code>AY</code> →<code>BG1</code>).</li><li><code>carA = 1, carB = 0</code>: Street A gets priority (transition from<code>BG2</code> →<code>BY</code> →<code>AG1</code>).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Output Consistency</strong>:</p><ul><li>The outputs (<code>lightsA</code> and<code>lightsB</code>) match the expected light status for each state in the state table:<ul><li><code>lightsA = 100</code> (Red for A) corresponds to<code>BG1</code>/<code>BG2</code> states.</li><li><code>lightsB = 001</code> (Green for B) corresponds to<code>BG1</code>/<code>BG2</code> states.</li><li><code>lightsA = 001</code> (Green for A) corresponds to<code>AG1</code>/<code>AG2</code> states.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Waveform Analysis</strong>:
The waveform visualizes the same transitions observed in the output table. Key points:</p><ul><li>The state bits change in accordance with the state transitions defined by the FSM.</li><li>The<code>lightsA</code> and<code>lightsB</code> signals follow the expected traffic light rules.</li><li><code>Reset</code> enforces the initial state (<code>AG2</code>), confirming the correctness of initialization.</li></ul>
